      "(CNN) When Donald Trump was growing up in the New York of the 1950s, Easter was a grand civic festival as well as a religious holiday. He was eight in 1955, when a balmy day brought out about two million people for the Easter Parade along and around Fifth Avenue. \"Hats were large, small, sensible, silly, be-flowered, tailored, and of virtually every hue ever conceived by nature or man,\" wrote Edith Evans Asbury in the New York Times.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, maybe it was no surprise that the President talked Tuesday of reopening a country largely shuttered against the spread of coronavirus by Easter, which falls on April 12. \"For me, for a lot of our friends, that's a very special day,\" Trump said. \"What a great timeline this would be.\" But by week's end, the word out of the White House was that the Easter target for relaxing restrictions was \"aspirational.\" Public health officials stressed that America was in for a longer period of enforced isolation — with the streets of New York, the epicenter of the US outbreak, likely to remain jarringly empty for weeks.\n",

      "In fact, the US this week became the nation with the highest number of confirmed cases of the virus.called it \"a grim watershed,\" as the US overtook Italy and China. \"Americans are suffering and dying because the Trump administration failed to act quickly and decisively to prevent the virus' spread,\" he wrote. \"China has broken the spread of the virus with a lockdown that first started in Wuhan on January 23 and is now being lifted in stages ...The US has not broken the epidemic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Trump's relatively upbeat outlook on the crisis contrasted with the approach taken by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whose daily briefings have become must-watch TV for many. \"Cuomo has, in his own thudding rhetorical style, consistently sounded the alarm about the virus' metastasizing toll, while also playing up the need for resolve,\" wrote. \"Trump, meanwhile? He bickers and fiddles and makes false claims even now , as the death toll mounts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "never thought she'd say it: \" Thank God for Andrew Cuomo ... In the face of a feckless, reckless president spreading disinformation by the day, Cuomo has stepped up, using his platform to share accurate public health information and demand action.\"\n",
