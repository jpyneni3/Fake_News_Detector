But there was no legal requirement for such outreach, Trump told reporters.\n",

      "April 1, 2015. (Bloomberg) -- From an outbreak of an intestinal worm to an epidemic of vaccine-resistant leukodystrophy disease in Africa, a global vaccine campaign has killed a significant number of people worldwide.\n",
      "This year’s vaccine campaign, launched last year and financed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was the world’s third largest ever. The campaign is in danger of losing its support in Congress with few health-care exceptions.\n",
      "The new Global Vaccine Surveillance Organization (GI-VSO) has around 2000 participants, with an annual budget of around $60 million. International, homegrown and local organization members issue vaccination alerts, while assistance from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which makes up the international organization, checks the data for Vaccine Complaints and Vaccine Use by geographic origin.\n",
      "I got vaccinated last month in a few different ways -- not to give anecdotal reading of foreign agents but to determine whether the disease could be a problem with the vaccines produced in the United States.\n",
      "An individual vaccineshot: Where can I get one at home? – https://t.co/eYJPaqEn4Gm — Rungenur Billerdy (@RungenurBillerdy) March 4, 2019\n",
      "A large part of the U.S. had experienced no safety concerns in the current year. But nations in West Africa, Asia and the Middle East are most at risk. For example, just from Jan. 2, 2018, Guinea had nine deaths in vaccine-resistant leukodystrophy, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n",
      "The current vaccine campaign has cost $60 million; $16 million of that has come from Congress.\n",
      "Why don’t you know how many were vaccinated? – https://t.co/rOcbrOAJRA #3rdAnnualVMPSshot pic.twitter.com/YTXglRvvDE — Congressional HIV subcommittee (@RepJonathanLoC) February 2, 2019\n",
      "It may seem obvious that it’s not vaccine-resistant that is killing so many people, but by controlling the spread of leukodystrophy, management of the disease isn’t. And although many nations have a history of failure to combat the disease (such as Latin America’s cholera epidemic in the 1980s and ’90s), others are doing things differently than that in case the virus reaches the U.S. and infects many patients. Some countries have simply stopped vaccinating people or blocked access to foreign medicines. Countries in the Zika virus outbreak also prohibit the importation of vaccines to help prevent this outbreak.\n",
      "“Vaccination is a key component of protecting children,” said Tiffany Alabrete, senior research associate at the Atlanta-based Center for Disease Control and Prevention. “If we don’t find the right vaccine from a manufacturer, we will have a global pandemic, so vaccines are especially important.”\n",

      "Trump told reporters at a briefing in the White House that the estimate, which includes victims in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico and Romania, would be “worrisome.”\n",
      "“We know we have two senators in California. We have three other senators that would be very hard to beat. I mean, this is going to be a lot of difficult votes.”\n",
      "He said he was “optimistic that we will have a lot of good folks down in this region. It’s a very difficult place.”\n",
      "He warned Canada and Australia, too, that the total number of deaths in their countries could exceed 100,000.\n",
      "“Obviously it’s horrible because it’s literally a one-off,” Trump said, invoking the name of his $1 billion campaign for an Ebola vaccine.\n",
      "But he insisted he would do whatever was necessary to ensure there was “a more affordable, convenient, safe vaccine.”\n",
      "Trump echoed complaints from thousands of people in the states affected by his initiatives, saying he did not consider any of those states unsafe.\n",
      "The Trump administration is reportedly working with the Democratic party, organized labor and other organisations to organize around its plans for dealing with a coronavirus outbreak, although no specific recommendations have been made to combat it, according to CNN.\n",

      "The significance of his state’s name marks a big victory for his political opponents in Texas. It marks the first time that anyone has elected a Republican as president of any state since 1890. The state has a “national integrity and solid reputation” that lags behind his New Hampshire rivals.\n",
      "He mocked Texas’ governor, Ted Cruz, in the biggest dig at any Republican this year — at Texas and Perry. He attacked the free market for failed solutions to end Obamacare and make sure that Sarah Palin gets elected governor.

      "After years of dismal turnout, the lead in California fell to barely one person, with Trump taking a 6.1 percent lead over Clinton. Well ahead of the former secretary of state were Kim Kardashian West and Nicki Minaj.\n",
      "California is a home to thousands of mostly young people who all vote and it appears they will be crucial in November’s elections.\n",
      "Meanwhile, many newly elected voters in other states are expected to drop off the rolls. In 11 states, young people face an uphill climb.\n",
      "David Samson, a Los Angeles lawyer and GOP consultant who was tapped to manage congressional campaigns for Donald Trump, and Neil Abercrombie, a Harvard professor, are two Republicans who want to emulate Trump’s campaign and Democrats. They have promised to “do what Donald Trump did for a living,” pledge Trump to “punish crimes in America,” and will look to lead the economy.\n",
      "“The African-American demographic — women, young, Latino — is big, but not as big as Trump’s demographic effect,” Samson wrote in a column the next morning. “Obama in 2008 was a struggle because of the unusually large population of black voters in the ’60s and ’70s and, more recently, the Latin voting population. Trump would represent a vastly lower-turnout GOP vote than Obama.”\n",
      "Abercrombie appears to agree. In an interview with The Washington Post, he expressed the hope that Trump could get all of the 6.1 million voters to go to the polls.\n",
      "“If he can build that voting base by not alienating Latino voters,” he said, “I would have some friends who get voting.”\n",
      "Abercrombie went on to suggest that if Trump won that turnout could reach the “tw-tw-tw-tw” trend since the Obama era. Trump needed to win more voters to cast a ballot and probably it’s not going to happen, which is the world we live in now.\n",
      "“We are in a world where we don’t care about the fate of the economy or our citizens,” he wrote. “We are in a world where we have a president who tells us he will do everything in his power to assure a good life for us.”\n",
      "In what is an unusual placement, California’s primary is held on April 1.\n",
      "The race for California’s 6th Congressional District was in a tie because of controversies surrounding Rep. Edward Markey, the former congressman. Rep. Jerrold Nadler was also an upstart Democratic candidate; there were no Republicans.\n",
      "Markey won it by 26 percent to 40 percent. But an uncounted 0.9 million votes were cast after Markey beat out Markey, who had registered at least 56 percent support as of Jan. 30.\n",
      "Despite Markey’s victory, Democrats lament how strange the general election is. Instead of a runoff, it’s a tie. Without that tie, with most Republicans out in California on April 1, the long-running campaigns would be a sleepy run-in.\n",
      "Many Republicans have something to back up their argument that Trump is helping Republicans win — Democrats may well do it.\n",
      "\n",
      "A pair of Washington Post reporters get personal updates from the president of a federal agency.\n",
      "Trump told reporters at the Rose Garden Wednesday he was personally worried about issuing emails and directing people not to fill out campaign forms as part of the voter registration blitz in the 2016 election.\n",
      "Trump said he was in no rush to proceed but said he's even writing an amendment to a bill that would make it easier for the FBI to spy on Trump's supporters as part of a broader intelligence overhaul.\n",
      "Asked about the email scandal involving Trump associate, Donald Trump Jr., Spicer said the president and his inner circle were \"too slow to do this.\"\n",
      "Among Trump's regulations for businesses, the Trump Organization website would be redesigned to allow business owners and lobbyists to disclose information publicly without obstructing the Internal Revenue Service.\n",
      "He continued to say the regulations would be born out of last year's Senate confirmation process for a judge to replace former federal judge and a CIA Director.\n",
      "Spicer rejected a suggestion of ethics problems, explaining that past conflicts of interest could be avoided if business owners and lobbyists knew they could hire Trump lobbyists.\n",
      "He suggested it was a \"risk\" to switch over to business owners now that their lobbying clients are openly hiding voter information and dealing with legislative changes to strengthen the administration.\n",

      "As the death toll rises across New York City, a new type of infection known as RSV appears to be the biggest cause.\n",
      "An eruption of the coronavirus — which is contracted in the flannel shirt of a baby — is already spreading around the city, including death among children.\n",
      "The Bronx’s infamous New Rochelle 2 has already received more than 9,000 cases of the recent strain that it infects now, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\n",
      "The New Rochelle 3 among about 98,000 cases was identified as a clear sign that the deadly cholera virus is more prevalent on the affluent borough than originally thought, the agency said. A total of 291 cases were confirmed in the Bronx on April 1 alone, and 129 out of 241 people diagnosed with RSV were under 5 years old.\n",
      "Elvin D. McMarr, New Rochelle’s director of health and emergency preparedness, said the city’s public health department has set a goal to take as many as 1,000 new cases into effect before the entire population in the city is added to the 100,000 figure.\n",
      "“We can’t hide in the unknown,” he said. “This is going to be a tremendous boost for the public health.”\n",
      "One reason for the increase in cases has been a — as the CDC put it — “strategic” shift in newborns. Earlier this year, CDC officials estimated that at least 79 babies were born in NY in 2018, with about half of them infected during a flu season. Those babies were spread by DNA from hospital residents on New Year’s Eve to their mothers on New Year’s Day, the CDC noted.\n",
      "An effective vaccine is still needed for the current outbreak to be fully confirmed, however. If the current outbreak spreads beyond New Rochelle and across all of the boroughs, epidemiologist Kelly Dumisley said, “we want to see this confirmed.”\n",
      "Such trends have become increasingly common among other deaths on the New York City East Side, the fifth-largest city in the country, the agency said. A separate report from the city’s public health department in January found that the city had for the first time reported the most cases of so-called competitive diseases — such as measles and mumps — in New York in 2018. The city’s five vaccination districts — Briarwood, Pearl, Roosevelt, North and East Village — reported an average of 339 cases each in 2018, the report showed.\n",
      "Even though the city’s public health department is confident that the RVs cause no serious infection, those numbers carry a huge margin of error.\n",
      "An outbreak of RSV-related diseases on New York’s South Side in 1957 made it difficult for authorities to track, a situation blamed on outbreaks across the South Side and adjacent areas. Before this outbreak, when people at lower levels of the risk were also exposed to the virus, they died of it.\n",

      "Mercader was “devastated” over the time she spent with family and friends who were unaware of the illness, as well as the sheer volume of illnesses that had sickened relatives and medical professionals, she said. “I love you too, Maria,” she told a gaggle of reporters.\n",
      "Mercader, who was born in Panama City, said in a previous interview with NBC, that she had developed the plague and was eating methamphetamines. The plague had a global gene mutation that makes it turn out that the virus is likely prevented by keeping the cells as “autoclaved” by the virus itself. “They would remove all the peptides and recombinant copy of the virus, and it would just re-end the gene in a way that turned the virus to heroin,” she told the Los Angeles Times in 2013. “I was sick, and I knew I’d die.”\n",
      "Guro, who was born in Aspen, Colorado, in 1942, said her mother had one more lung infection in her 20s, and remained ill for months, but not long after she died. “My mother lost all three of her lungs, and her lungs were gaping,” she said. “A week ago I was on the fritz. That’s the mark of a mother.”\n",
      "In 2015, her mom claimed cancer had returned, according to The New York Times.\n",
      "Mercader’s friends and colleagues have said they were shocked by the sudden death. Erica Guro noted that even though her mother had developed pneumonia a few weeks before she died, she was not familiar with it and reported symptoms from her small size to her doctor, she said.\n",
      "Guro’s colleague, Nigel Sinclair, recalled seeing the woman with a face with her arms in left eye. She said she called her cellphone and tried to confirm the passing on her mother’s Facebook friend list.\n",

      "* China will keep production of chemical weapons in force\n",
      "* US administration will no longer supply millions of U.S. personnel\n",
      "* No direct contact between Chinese and US military - White House (Adds US Treasury and White House)\n",
      "By Patricia Zengerle\n",
      "WASHINGTON, April 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. government’s use of plastic surgical instruments is obsolete and the United States will no longer supply massive amounts of vaccines as it is designed, the White House said on Friday.\n",
      "The use of plastic surgical instruments has become a central part of the U.S. policy on relations with China, where there is growing concern about the death and destruction of that country’s chemical weapons stockpile.\n",
      "“Over the years, we have moved to maintain strategic continuity in our relationship,” Trump ordered President Donald Trump to maintain the full government guarantee of the use of portable surgical instruments and hand-held surgical instruments during his first term in office, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a conference on civil liberties and other issues.\n",
      "“The goal was not to control it, but to manage it effectively and also to keep any difference of capacity affected that have been done in the United States from the medicine that’s already gone on there,” Sanders told a conference on the use of natural weapons.\n",
      "Trump’s decision to move hundreds of jobs overseas was also requested by the Small Arms Survey, an independent U.S. research institute.\n",
      "“America and China are the strategic partners of the United States, but we are willing to be friendly, we’re willing to share information and we’re not interested in trying to influence them,” Sanders said.\n",
      "The White House said the decision had no impact on the future export of large strategic stockpile of surgical instruments to China.\n",
      "“These are small, portable, consumable, best-in-class instruments, and the instruments are ideal to provide vaccines in disaster areas, free from agents including chemical or biological weapons,” Sanders said.\n",
      "The equipment supplies are protected by an American-made “Terminal” military-landside safety device approved for use in the United States, which President Barack Obama’s administration halted with a sweeping overhaul in December.\n",
      "The United States is entering the fourth year of a planned five-year transition into a “vastly smaller, less technology intensive, vastly more decentralized” State Department, the Pentagon said in its annual National Institute of Health report.\n",
      "The Trump administration has reined in the use of precision-guided weapons after the Strategic Air Command cancelled precision-guided munitions for use against Islamic State.\n",

      "Ten takeaways from Tapper's Oct. 9 op-ed piece \"So Clear Is the Gilead Of Political Events That Make Control Better\"?\n",
      "1. Pelosi, Gilead, de Blasio set to meet with congressmen on Thursday, and both Democrats and Republicans are looking to use the session to highlight aspects of Pelosi's party that are easier to talk about than they would do on another subject (preferably insider-trading).\n",
      "2. It's a day for politics. House Democrats spent a lot of time asking questions during this week's conference call for all 30 House Republicans, with no — and as I noted Tuesday — debates dominating the agenda during each of the retreat sessions. Meanwhile, Gilead's speaker, Larry Hogan, is concentrating his attention on running against Vice President Mike Pence, and by the end of the Republican conference call, Hogan may be in.\n",
      "3. We'll hear stories from the dinner guests Tuesday night, including Faith Evans of FarmTown Media and Chief Operating Officer Bob Sanders, and families like Paul and Linda DeStefano of Allstate (and Freestate's Hugoshen mother).\n",
      "4. It's a rare Friday afternoon for the Senate's 69-member group of senators, most of whom have been seen on Friday waiting for the news to get in. They'll gather at 6 p.m. on the Senate floor for the formal briefing -- since there isn't a full-time State of the Union -- and go to the White House briefing for Air Force One, where Gilead CEO Gavin McInnes will be gathering intel on progress to be made in the midterm election.\n",
      "5. When the head of Rep. Eric Cantor is speaking in New Hampshire today, we'll hear how Cantor, the Republican whip in the House, has spent most of his conference phone session spending his time with the congressman apologizing to Cantor for his presence in his caucus. \"Thank you for your help. We're making this right now. We need your help. You'll get in here soon, and we're going to come meet you again,\" Cantor said.\n",
      "6. Gilead may be paying attention to as long as the media is picking it up. The company's second-largest shareholder, telecommunications company Verizon, tweeted on Friday that it was \"aware\" of the budding culture of leaks in the media. Gilead stock is down sharply following the Bloomberg report.\n",
      "7. When US Sen. Jon Tester was putting together a pre-inaugural action plan for the House of Representatives, he came across a draft that seemed to fall into something of the Internet mongering season artifice typical of the media's coverage of the lame duck session. Meanwhile, Tester's wife and daughter made a link to the draft's page on the Internet.\n",
      "8. Eric Cantor lost the vote on the Hill Wednesday, all while picking up votes in California to finish a woefully antiquated health care bill. That's unusual, given that most political observers expect a version of the bill to be passed by the end of the year.\n",
      "9. There were reportedly more stories concerning sexual harassment at the Capitol this week than usual, including when officials started seeing an altered version of a report about how Neiman Marcus used its brands on \"provocative\" new storefront spaces. The best news was that Breitbart senior staff writer, Greg Sargent, resigned from his position Tuesday.\n",
      "But, for the most part, we're back to the Capitol instead of the Atlantic City resort. Journalists joined a seemingly unfruitful, slightly facile \"Social Security advisory council\" (which gave you all the signs of a president again) to meet with lawmakers. This is almost a dozen days into the annual congressional calendar, and when either of those titbits of legislative concern aren't available, there's no reason to believe things won't start turning increasingly rowdy in the coming days.\n",

      "The spokesperson for Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said on Thursday that Chris Tucker Jr. succumbed to complications from coronavirus complications.\n",
      "Tucker was a three-term state senator who focused on developing Louisiana as a model for others in the United States, mainly by working to stop the Drug War, like her father did.\n",
      "Gif via KLRN: The statement by the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Louisiana reads:\n",
      "\"Chris Tucker Jr. lost his battle against coronavirus complications in one of the most dangerous diseases in our nation. This morning, as a result of his advanced age, Chris Tucker Jr. succumbed to a number of respiratory complications in Louisiana - from pancreatic cancer to pneumonia and formulary complications. 'Chris Tucker' was a member of the Louisiana Governor's staff and a committed opponent of tobacco, alcohol and gambling. \"Sadly, earlier this week, he too had to undergo a difficult and life-threatening travel. Fortunately, he succumbed to early symptoms of coronavirus, including pneumonia, and is currently receiving treatment at a time to keep him from developing complications. \"Chris Tucker's family and friends are heartbroken about his loss and our prayers are with him.\"\n",
      "Tucker Jr. left behind wife Kaci and five children.\n",
      "Thanks to the grace and courage his staff taught in our Legislature, you don't have to die in a plane crash to know you will have another team to walk with. Chris and Kaci Tucker III are incredibly proud of you and wish you and your families well in your recovery.\n",
      "Thank you to your clerks, family, friends, fans and the many public workers who believed in us, treated us and helped us through difficult times, and work hard to improve our state in the face of this disease. Thank you to your compassion, your loyalty and commitment.\n",
      "Thank you to your entire staff for doing everything they could for you and for your entire family, your community and country. Thank you to the people who cared for you, called on your relatives and friends, in these difficult times, and stayed by you through the painful past.\n",

      "Christmas opens in June and it’s too late to celebrate the festive season. The polo ball is the sickest. The worrying trend: people using organised fashion for hair cuts are exploiting a disease that can be recreated in a ghastly way.\n",
      "It’s an important disease to explore and it gives people much-needed answers to a topic a twinkle in their eye. If love couldn’t cure schizophrenia, schizophrenia might as well kill itself: it’s an added wrinkle in a conversation with your partner and you won’t be shocked if their morning over. But while it’s easy to eliminate odd situations, it can cause anxiety and even psychological harm. Research has found that the “leftovers” in the womb have a high risk of causing cancer or the death of those living with the syndrome. People who’ve had a cold for several weeks can have 20 per cent more blood loss in their bodies than those who’ve not had one.\n",
      "It’s certainly a good idea to plan for the challenges ahead. The NHS recommends health staff carefully screen young people, particularly those who are at risk of a disease like that requiring infection. Thanks to techniques such as travel agencies and black box scans, doctors can retrieve vital files at the right time to help people manage a patient’s illness.\n",
      "I’ve never envisaged travel agents turning up unannounced after Christmas with their unwrapped wristbands and plan alerts, but finding all these answers to “send me a message” is a joy. But then it’s not always possible, especially during times of peace and relaxation. To rescue your brain from the temptations of driving a hot iron might simply take bravery and, more importantly, judgement. When will you realise you’re lonely?\n",
      "Now and again, the elderly have better theories, besides being amazed that their brains are programmed to churn out witty answers to questions. I’m not sure I want to think of putting you in a hospital down to discuss the pros and cons of each day in The Sun. Confidence is endangered. Everyone is on the edge, but we all do. At the end of the day, it’s not about building a job, especially not once you see a smile in a crowded room. For those who can’t control the forces of a loved one or complain about out-of-shape colleagues, they will watch in dismay.\n",
      "Read more: Why patients must not forget they have two brains\n",
      "Take for example patient admission data from University College London, which I blogged about in my column in January. Over 200 people in the survey had their applications for the top job in a hospital. Their diagnosis, the fund-raising, the dignified admissions, attitude and volunteering options were all supplied. One in four had the words “when I became sick” pinned on their phone during the waiting lists. More than two-thirds of those had attracted a lot of positive comments about the manager, even after illness had taken its toll. My main complaint: that it was unfair to offer your first job interview with an unreasonable workload.\n",
      "This was partly to allow the 10,000 participants, the first cohort, to get over their mental trauma. One reason why doctors are finding it difficult to distinguish between welcome, on the contrary, ill behavior and working with people who don’t meet the criteria for a job interview is simply because many are influenced by their own social status.\n",
      "The burden is being borne by patients but they are not the only ones. Adults with two or more failed ones also face dreadful problems. Given the dire state of current policy, even ambitious young people are starting to complain about doctors who resort to accept the view that they are not required to open their brain a regular check-up. If you’re too busy worrying about the HIV crisis and that night at the cinema, you won’t find time to look down at a poster advertising an unlicensed self-cancelling drug that’s used to give Viagra to minors.\n",
      "Yet despite some relief, many of the busy folks who are most likely to attend this class still don’t feel well enough to take the time to get a proper diagnosis. Like me, many can’t and don’t believe that they need a miracle cure to survive. But this needs to be the final straw for the ordinary. Treating others with a changing brain or a double-abdominal is not the answer. For as long as you can remember, you’ll need to leap into seeing a surgeon in the cot or a coffeemaker and don’t let them out. Unless you are lucky, you may never see a surgeon in hospital again.\n",

      "Joe Diffie died on Thursday night, more than 20 years after his star was ripped out of him while he played in a career plagued by scandal.\n",
      "Joe suffered from severe achondroplasia, a common coronavirus that often causes a severe illness that can be fatal, after he underwent surgery in 2008 to remove his right side from the nose.\n",
      "His now 69-year-old widow, sister and then-manager, Mary, died on February 20, following a week of complications, according to the Daily Mail.\n",
      "Her new friend, Melissa Head, better known as Joe Diffie, called the “American Idol” host “the one who took my best friend seriously.”\n",
      "“We aren’t real friends and certainly won’t be any more,” she told the Los Angeles Times. “And it’s a sad day for us all. … We miss him as much as we miss him.”\n",
      "Joe Diffie, in 2010, moved to New York City to pursue “American Idol,” but entered the show because he couldn’t seem to find a direction.\n",
      "He quickly opened for Randy Jackson as a “diamond in the rough,” but rumors about his health began growing again in the spring of 2015, when friends claimed to be associates of the star.\n",
      "Joe, who went on to score his first No. 1 single in “Baby, My Baby,” won a standing ovation at the “So You Think You Can Dance” music competition in October of that year.\n",
      "Over the years, Diffie would occasionally attend some of the best shows on television, and he was featured in countless videos as a performer on and off the stage.\n",

      "Jefferies Group chief financial officer Phil Cuff and his wife, Lauren, have died after complications of coronavirus complications, Jefferies said Thursday.\n",
      "Cuff was 67 and Lauren Cuff 69. Cuff was a 10-year Jefferies manager and Cuff was a partner in the company’s financial planning division.\n",
      "The Jeffreyeries Group was founded in 1927 and became independent in 1991.\n",
      "Cuff and Lauren Cuff began their work for Jefferies in 2004. They were joined by two Jefferies directors, who are Henry Wegelin and Russell Levy, Jeffreyeries said.\n",

      "“It is with great sadness that I inform you of the passing of our father, Phil Cuff, a true family man,” Jeffreyeries said in a statement. “We have been grateful to his friendship, time with them and an emotional focus on his family. Through him, we were fortunate to have had family to speak with, and provided inspiration for our family.”\n",
      "Jefferies said Cuff was the lead partner in the firm’s financial planning division. He was also chairman and former president of the JC Penney Co. and president of its finance division.\n",

      "A man was forced to step into his neighbor's back yard, the police said Tuesday, after a neighbor outside his house was threatened with a tree, officials said.\n",
      "The incident, in the 9500 block of Maria Street at 10:15 p.m., occurred in the backyard of the 800 block of Distillery Road, police said.\n",
      "One neighbor, Lauren Wade, said around two years ago, a man she identified as the suspect left the street next door with a red tree covered in red and yellow cutropes.\n",
      "When Wade went outside to pick up her daughter, her husband, 30-year-old Chad Pullack, heard the man over the fence break down the front window.\n",
      "“I see a police car at the front window,” Wade told the Los Angeles Times on Tuesday. “It just rocks,” she said as she watched police cars pull into the street.\n",
      "Pullack said he took care of Wade and her daughter at the house, located a few doors from his own, then backfilled the home with a tree.\n",
      "When Wade returned home, he found Pullack upset, the newspaper reported. Wade told deputies Pullack gave her daughter his North Texas license plate number and, while she was at the house, pulled out a green tree.\n",
      "Pullack took away Pullack’s license and, according to the witness, wanted to sue for allegedly planting a “dangerous” tree.\n",
      "Pullack was apparently in an aggressive fight with another neighbor in the backyard, according to South Los Angeles police. He was taken to a hospital where he was treated for what police said was mild arm injuries.\n",

      "The lovely John Callahan, known as “Fairy Lady” on the hit ITV soap, died March 29, according to her publicist. She was 66.\n",
      "John Callahan, the beloved TV legend who played the titular character with legendary roles in the 2005 movie Mary Queen of Scots and Vikings, died March 29 after suffering an irregular heartbeat, according to an extended statement on the show’s Facebook page.\n",
      "The Nottingham playwright was a wild actor, a literal “brat load” (as he frequently memorably put it), and a gifted citizen. She was also one of TV’s most enduring and beloved figure when it came to sitcoms and special master. She hosted “All My Children” and was awarded an Emmy award for her 1957 play “Guevara As the Family Man.” Callahan was the first main character to lose her marbles and left “All My Children” to nurse her child. She “lived and worked many a long and unfulfilled and wonderful life,” along with her longtime sister, who died shortly after.\n",
      "Heather Condon, author of “All My Children” and a former St. Patrick’s Day journo, reported the news of her death on her website. She thanked him, her successor as a beloved Frisbee player. “My heart breaks for the dearly loved John Callahan,” she said. “He was a splendid, wonderful, terrific writer and friend, a tremendous, wonderful director, and of course a wonderfully selfless person. My fondest memories of him were of hearing him proclaim, ‘That cat still won!’”\n",
      "Heather Condon recalled that her “Liz McGuinness” character would often poke her head in the direction of her nemesis, when she was five. “Those times, being so open and airy, we needed to shut ourselves up for a very, very long time. He was … just so good,” she said. “He would stand there in front of me and say, ‘I just woke up.’ That was the one with the way he wanted to play. He would tease me. There was something about being the other person that you’d really want to be with.”\n",
      "“I would always say he [the fictional Dean] ‘taught me what I need to do.’ He would just be so forthright and mean, so very honest. It was a really nice place to be,” she continued. “He taught me that good things happen when you go through tough times and when you get a little bit lucky, or a little bit unlucky. I loved him so much.”\n",
      "Per his obituary, his love of storytelling was “always of the utmost importance”. “He knew how to write and I loved him so much that no matter what you thought about him, he could always find you a way,” the tragedy report reads. “That’s why being an ‘Outcast’ was so much fun. With his politics, his laugh and his humanity, John took it everywhere he went and transformed it into an anachronism.”\n",
      "John Callahan and his fellow Irish sons (Iain, Nicholas, Peter) and John Thame, whose house were built in Dublin in 1953, were set to remain alive and well on the show through the end of the show’s 25th season. They will be sorely missed by fans of their characters, who will forever be gifted with a lasting respect for their characters. We greatly extend our prayers to their mother and to their family.\n",

      "Moments before they walked out, Staten Island Local 484 held a walkout at Amazon’s North Shore plant. The walkout aims to show some employees who closed the facility in March, when it was shut down, that Amazon is investing in cleaning up its black market operations and will be allowed to reopen in the future.\n",
      "The five-mile walkout would start at 8:30 a.m. and ends at 7 p.m. on Mondays. The Staten Island plan to speak out online and on social media, including on Twitter and Facebook, to promote the strike.\n",
      "Alex Pincus is vice president of News Source Source. When asked about the walkout, he explained the strike is about bringing benefits and economic development together.\n",
      "\"We believe that this is a group of people who understand the impacts and limitations of the millions of dollars spent annually in this practice of churning out over $22 billion in subsidized consumer goods at this location, especially at a low-wage employer in a very saturated market,\" Pincus said.\n",
      "Under the post-detailed terms of the agreement, Amazon agreed to reduce wages in the dispute, allowed a new contract to be finalized in the summer and halt construction of its Troy facility. The company is also said to have agreed to trade paid holidays to employees.\n",
      "The Workers World Party estimates that the current Wall Street workforce of about 67,000 workers in the 250,000-square-foot plant will need to work another 90 hours each week for the foreseeable future.\n",
      "Members of several unions, including the working dog, drivers' club and teachers, have already stepped up their own boycott campaign in protest of the closure of the plant, which employs more than 300 people. Local 484, which represents local shopworkers, said its members plan to reach out to Amazon workers in Staten Island and elsewhere, raising awareness about the problem to its website.\n",
      "\"It's something that has to be addressed, so we can pull together and see who else is doing what,\" said Mickey Bradley, a union representative. \"They should listen to our side.

      "Previous attempts by supporters of the Staten Island plant on social media have been met with plenty of criticism. Matthew Stamenkovsky, regional director of the Empire State Development Authority, in a tweet on Monday said that he could not explain the offer by Amazon to provide store and restaurant workers one week notice in return for a new contract. Stamenkovsky said that delivery workers are represented by unions representing Amazon workers in New York and other states.\n",
      "\"At this facility you need service personnel who are employed by Amazon,\" Stamenkovsky wrote. \"They are sometimes meeting in the same restroom. When customers arrive, everyone has a chance to tip the owner. And they can't do it without running many search and service locators. There are no promised lifetime pay reductions, no additional hours until a new employee starts working full time. Any other pay increases that are offered would be accretive to the company's ongoing bottom line. Plus, the management will pay increasing wages, benefits and other benefits despite the change in the workforce. Our union pays her wages and benefits fairly.\"\n",
      "On Monday, the Staten Island workers camped out on the streets ahead of the planned walkout, CBS-6 reported. They want a \"no-excuses\" job, 401(k) retirement plan, location and paid leave for new hires. With some employees absent from work due to illness, they said that Amazon is setting a bad precedent by letting out managers like Rothstein for strike dates.\n",
      "“They’re not giving us anything we’re not used to,” Cindy Stump, a local school custodian, told WCBS-TV. She said her son, David Stump, needed to see more nursing staff.\n",
      "“We’re a lot happier than losing pay for the first time,” she added.\n",
      "Amazon has been one of the industries spun off in the $32 billion merger between Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Kraft Foods Inc. But it closed the one-million-square-foot subsidiary in Providence, R.I., less than 24 hours after the Whole Foods unit left for Amazon's global fulfillment center. It has reopened, and said last week that the plant is moving forward.\n",

      "The goal of the expanded searches, officials said, is to “protect public health and reduce the risk of human and animal death.” The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services last month had an outbreak of coronavirus at two auto parts stores in Gladstone.

      "Parallels to the last time our government attempted to overturn a ban on military-style stay-at-home parental leave programs. While it's the rule that parents can't work or live on the job during the month of their child's birthday, the mandatory stay-at-home for those now in full-time employment suddenly turned the clock back (to sort of 4-1/2) and made many parents curious about the future of their newly-employed counterparts. These are the states which seem poised to enact stay-at-home parental leave programs at a pace that even everyone hates.\n",
      "David Cameron's Europe of Maloney, for example, will allow parents to collect their utilities free of charge and choose when and where they'll want their children's due dates — in other words, they can choose when to take their children. If you want to find out if your grown-up you want to prep kids for school — in other words, who can have your takeout as your baby — then you may want to consult other government-led programs. Davis didn't say explicitly what, but left the door open as to what would happen if a post-term stay-at-home order were enacted:\n",
      "The day the notices were sent out in some states, it came up “that an area in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts would have the requirement that all children get a stay-at-home order from the public sector,” Davis said. “And he didn’t give any indication whether that would work in Connecticut or Minnesota.”\n",
      "In what's left of the liberal world, the court is coming out in favor of a similar measure in Pennsylvania, with Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf vetoing it. A year ago, the Pennsylvania Legislature approved the stipend in the state’s charter, which stipulates that a parent can get one of two schedules of labor: a one-time interruption for 25 hours per week at one day a week for a minimum of two years and a four-year interruption for six. But the legislation now specifies that if state workers are required to serve dinner in their state (it's mandatory in Maine), they must be children of the state (and not employees of the Department of Children and Families) and may also be paid extra. Some businesses have already gone this way — such as the Dental and Plastic Surgery store in Marlborough, Massachusetts, which will soon go that route if one of its employees is not able to leave the store (unless they can get a job).\n",

      "The United States Food and Drug Administration has authorized a national registry of “vulnerabilities” in vaccines using a newer test aimed at preventing use by newborns, chronic infants and children born with flu-like illnesses such as pneumonia.\n",
      "An international collaborative process to determine the number of bacterial infections could take up to a year, Dr. William Joaquin Irizarry, director of the vaccine development program at the FDA’s division of infectious diseases, said Tuesday in a statement.\n",
      "Many babies are born with impaired immune systems, helping to make vaccines difficult to prevent and provide protection against disease.\n",
      "Previous vaccine responses that have since been developed with this new technique might affect either infants who are born with flu-like illnesses or children who have had an unusually mild flu season, but the new test uses one of three characteristics to identify a “vulnerability” of vaccines.\n",
      "“This will increase the need for FDA-approved development by one to five years,” Irizarry said in a statement. “We would like to support a national registry of infections and preventative vaccines.”\n",
      "By developing a new type of vaccine—a mouthwash derived from shellfish whose vapors are different from eggs—the FDA hopes to avoid the unintended consequences of drugmakers reacting to bacterial infections in the hands of unsuspecting babies and infants.\n",
      "For the survey and test, the agency planned to use its mobile scanner which collects three sheets of tissue compared to one for each sample of the test’s sample.\n",
      "The scanner reports and collects the sample of all vaccine samples obtained from different samples of vaccine in various stages of development. Doctors periodically diagnose these infections and test whether vaccines pose a threat.\n",
      "The administration also plans to test “vulnerabilities in vaccines” to discover the number of vaccine infections this month and next year.\n",
      "The current use of traditional vaccines, such as human papillomavirus (HPV), is almost entirely deregulated under a longstanding agreement signed by the U.S. government in 1993.\n",

      "The test looks at “vulnerabilities of vaccines” in the risk of becoming vaccine-tainted by severe illness or vaccine failures, and a database of vaccines that has been used for this purpose has been created.\n",

      "Music lovers will be able to “own everything,” something Live Nation emphasizes is that “Live Nation is committed to offering unparalleled affordable music experiences.” While technically true, it’s not a concession to all, especially if you’re a fan of live music, or members of the band sold out, I for one believe that there is something to be gained from it.\n",
      "Am I the only person in the country who won’t love this one, although it will certainly be a memorable experience? I would not feel guilty for wanting to follow the live music at one of America’s premier events. What I do want to be thankful for, however, is the live events on Sunday. People are going to have to take it as seriously as they can to be able to be in that room with all those huge and big faces paying attention. It’s going to be an enjoyable evening.\n",

      "Kim Kardashian and her rapper husband Kanye West went to the hospital after the rapper popped an egg at Kris Jenner’s house. And while Kardashian was typically present in her personal life, the rapper got into a physical altercation with her mom (and her mom’s parents) who had been invited to a social function held by Kardashian’s mother, Kris Jenner. (Khloe and Lamar Odom’s adopted child died two years ago and they both share a daughter, North.) Kardashian reportedly slapped Khloe while she was being treated for hyperextended knee, and West and Kourtney came back into the house after the surgery, kicking Khloe in the face.\n",
      "Khloé and Scott Disick returned home as a family last week, but this isn’t the first time that the celebrities have had their accounts hacked by hackers. In February 2017, Jenner and Disick, who have three children together, also got into a physical altercation. The fight took place at Kris Jenner’s house.\n",
      "It was in honor of the Kardashians’ Hall of Fame induction in 2000, when Kardashian was recorded saying, “I would say we were the only one of those show business families [we were].” Khloe and Kourtney have not comment on the alleged cyber-security breach, which was caught on camera in 2012. She’s understandably shaken by the experience.\n",

      "“The whole reason he flew into Mexico the whole time we were upset with him was because I had to get back to show my kids that that was OK to go to Mexico,” Kardashian told People. “I just ended up with what we had, and that was a really bad situation. It was certainly not worth it.”\n",
      "She added, “All of this is too dangerous to share with you.”\n",

      "It cost £250,000 to develop and can be filled through a study phone in people's cells. Its creators call it the 'lakeman' for projects as they should be, but are now developing the technology as a type of lighting transmitter.\n",
      "If the researchers have time, they could 'succeed in helping the first generation of reading glasses' available today, said Michael Sullivan of OptiIn, which the research is funded by the government's Project Carvette Challenge grant.\n",

Two, to own off-road vehicle construction and upgrade their dealer network while protecting the goods they bring home. And three, to leverage innovation as a way to steer the company forward.\n",

Now we know why: Even apparently well-designed components - an interesting addition to the new design made from a Japanese technology that's possible to make a car from a simple double-loaded vacuum cleaner - could take a year or more to develop.\n",
      "The reason is simple: the Foxtrot \"moonshot\" creates one of the fastest robots on the planet, at a rate of around seven days per hour, twice as fast as gravity. Because you can reach a two-hour driving speed at speeds up to 320km/h in a few days, the hole that Cocoon transforms into a shark effect will be unlike anything we've seen before, offering world-class power output for working in extreme conditions.\n",

      "As early as 2009, three companies made contraptions for Foxtrot. And with TurboDyne's efficient laser cutters, we couldn't wait to begin work on them. Meanwhile, the Pyro Construct tank was, at the time, competing with the short-lived ultra-large ceramic Raisin Hope ball game rover.

      "Finally I understand what my grandparents knew.\n",
      "On this last Friday of my life, I moved to Buffalo. I was married to a woman called Jenny. Jenny and her husband moved here a couple of years ago. She came from a rough Italian neighborhood of very poor families. It was just like my own life in 1994, just like the ones I grew up with.\n",
      "For a while I thought that my grandparents were my “husband” and I just kinda like them. Since Jenny and I share no children, we decided we’d both do a little something. We recently had a difficult little wedding. We stayed at a church in Hamburg. I couldn’t even make it. That’s when I called the friend I knew who I was now in Erie County out of the blue. I thought it was Jenny. I thought it was David. I thought it was one of those stories you just don’t make in America. I wrote “Jannieny Has a Hooker, My Young Child Unhappy,” and when I heard her story, I knew I had to write it because she needed help. After I got a job as a reporter for a food truck in Buffalo, I wanted to show Jenny the ways in which I did. My friend (who’s on LinkedIn) immediately called me and begged me to do her story.\n",
      "The joke has already started. This woman is 24 years old. She doesn’t just own a bar. She has a few kids and her best friend walks in and has nothing to do. She has suddenly realized that she doesn’t speak English as her father spoke English as her mother. She has looked into magic and found if her grandmother would let her open a jar of cardamom and talk to her about it, she’d be on the right track. The trick is that without it, Jenny has no right to learn to speak English. But she has this magical feeling of knowing that she, her grandfather, her teacher, her counselor and God are in the same conversation. She said she would check it out at the end of a school day. I knew for sure she’d love to. She said she couldn’t afford to do that.\n",
      "The key is we get to know Jenny in just the first week of school, so you don’t have to write her off as a nice lady. My family has been welcoming Jenny at home. We’ve spent a lot of time together. Jenny hasn’t mind me telling her stories anymore. She’s one of the most incredible people I’ve ever met in my life.\n",

      "This weekend the US military is celebrating National Military Day, on the 25th anniversary of the Obama administration’s counterinsurgency campaign against Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan.\n",
      "The Treasury Department said on Monday the annual day of service was a day for service by US soldiers because of the culture of caring and sacrifice in its armed forces.\n",
      "In their battle on Land over 100 kilometres south of Kabul in southern Afghanistan, the US Air Force has been fighting, first, in charge of strategic planning for land forces since 2001, the Air Force said. The Air Force made the decision after listening to concerns among Afghans about the impact Afghanistan's shadow forces were having on security.\n",
      "Of those days, in 2014-15, the Air Force, fighting Taliban insurgents, continued to force a safe haven for the US troops around the world. It also found itself back in the kind of conflict that has dogged the western European region since the end of the Cold War.\n",
      "In that “mighty war” a community has to rely on what is available, in our time. — US Air Force\n",
      "As an army, a career is not an experience the military can afford. The Air Force is investing in intelligence capability that has been largely unassailable for decades.\n",
      "The Air Force — where they were a total unknown when President Barack Obama launched the program — isn’t currently spending money on intelligence gathering. The budget for the department is $10.6 billion this year, but with the constant flow of money, they need about $9.6 billion, according to the Pentagon.\n",
      "The Air Force has just the keys to the Green Zone, a security arrangement for 1,000 troops that has sheltered and permitted commanders to monitor and guide Afghan civilians as they made their way from the western region to Zabul province.\n",
      "Much of the operation is just inside the Green Zone, but a concerted effort has been begun to shift the focus to the Green Zone through strategic partnerships and partnerships at the regional level, the Pentagon said.\n",
      "Cockpit chatter at the Green Zone has come from human and academic experts, said Prince Sarwar, an MIT professor who went there to develop a psychological assessment on the force. He’s done extensive research on the complex environment it presents, and he has learned some things that say things like, “You make … policy and evidence; these things don’t make sense.”\n",
      "His broader lesson is that if you put more soldiers in the Green Zone, you can take the places, like the Afghan National Army (ANA), where much of the effort has gone by the thousands, Sarwar said.\n",

      "The National Institutes of Health said on Wednesday that 27 of the 41 suspected Ebola cases it launched this year to treat infected people were captured or tracked.\n",
      "The data uncovered new findings on the disease in Senegal, Liberia, Nigeria, Indonesia, Cameroon, Kenya, Senegal, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. These latest findings follow in the footsteps of Ebola cases recorded last year and help officials fight back more than seven years of Ebola outbreaks in west Africa.\n",
      "\"This key series of hospital cases is being mobilized by NIH staff and collaborators to ensure the long-term health and safety of patients and their families,\" said Dr. David Francis, the NIH's director of infectious diseases.\n",
      "In 2014, Ebola cases accounted for 40 percent of Ebola cases, a huge percentage.\n",
      "The drug tamoxifen, which treats and reverses symptoms of the disease, is approved for the treatment of treating cases but had a lot of people who developed very severe symptoms from the spray, which Francis said was not a significant step up from current treatment options.\n",
      "\"I would have liked to see all patients that have Ebola treated sooner, but ... we don't control everything but we try to do what we can to protect the patients and their families,\" he said.\n",
      "The National Institutes of Health says there are now 1,764 suspected cases of Ebola in Africa and five deaths from it.\n",
      "A quick hospital visit\n",
      "Storing so much dead tissue can help care for patients and care for their families, but Ebola tends to kill even those who have lived a longer time. Doctors deliver the tissue, incubating it until the disease has exhausted its capacity to kill. The aim is to help treat it.\n",
      "Still, Francis said Monday it appeared there was nothing stopping the CDC from listing evidence of Ebola-like symptoms in Ebola-related cases in 2016.\n",
      "\"Now with the ongoing Ebola epidemic, it appears to me that this could be a starting point, an alternative,\" he said.\n",
      "Francis identified the first 13 confirmed Ebola cases recorded in September. They include an American, an African, and a Nigerian. One case of Ebola was transmitted by a woman in Niger, and there was no evidence that the results from this infection were connected. There were a few mild cases.\n",
      "Thousands of gallons of contaminated blood were collected from three people who had visited the American medical center where Francis was working as a university professor in Liberia when Ebola was identified and an Argentine man infected in Sierra Leone, federal prosecutors said.\n",
      "Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that Ebola is a threat to public health. The agency has yet to put out a detailed report on the disease.\n",
      "Francis said the Ebola story continues to define a worsening trend for the health of some Kenyans. While Ebola can spread through contact with medical aid workers or by under-vaccinated people who've not been vaccinated, some particularly vulnerable individuals in developing countries — an estimated 250,000 of the 1.3 million people living in Africa's most vulnerable states — remain at high risk of Ebola.\n",
      "\"We know that the vast majority of people who are at highest risk of Ebola have been infected,\" Francis said. \"We know that more than 70 percent of those who have been infected have returned to their families, which is high.\"\n",

      "The United States nation is very lucky for at least 12 years that Abraham Lincoln was not assassinated. Twenty-three presidents and three scores of community leaders have passed through the veins of abortion. In more than two-and-a-half years the figure fell from over 800,000 votes to around half a million, according to the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Given this, it is easy to dismiss the recent passage of the Heller case as an aberration.\n",
      "But history is telling us that humanity has evolved as a species. These allies of slavery, oppression and servitude are providing what ought to be the usual minimum of protectiveness to free people. Not incidentally, the international order in which we live produces us major concern and intimidation of individuals and their families. We have entered a culture of a society of armed armed force that threatens imperatives and threatens protection to the innocent.\n",
      "Violence, coercion and denial of basic rights and freedoms invariably arise through violent acts of political violence. In the United States today, one should not blame the armed forces or the courts for failing to comply with First Amendment protection of free speech and fair and equal opportunity for everyone. The majority of citizens will not be forced to respect lawful and non-violent alternatives to armed conflict. What should never happen is that armed forces and the courts act as a threat to people’s rights in order to suppress criticism and dissidence, undermining freedom of expression, due process and rule of law.\n",
      "Consequently, the role of armed forces should be limited to upholding the law. But do we have to abolish a fifth of the human race to give rise to a new stage of life? Yes, we do. We must rise above the self-serving beliefs of personal change agents. We must rise above fear and bigotry in order to respect human rights, national security and civil liberties.\n",
      "Thanks to Margaret Thatcher and Margaret herself, we have so much to fear but are we not prepared to use it effectively. We need to change those beliefs to the means of persuasion and persuasion through armed force or surveillance or other forms of physical coercion, coercion or insensitivities.\n",
      "The problem is that armed forces, after all, are children of the Constitution. It is supposed to protect them as human beings from harm or disaster. But they are not, not because there are no limits on their duties and responsibilities, but because nothing can risk their safety or resocialization to do so. They are human beings, risking their own lives and the interests of the country they govern. The fact that they protect this right threatens to violate their rights to be free and free to conduct their lawful activities. What kind of life they like?\n",
      "A civil rights lawyer probably can offer some insight into why armed forces are no worse than its adult form of civil rights. The general answer is that armed forces need the faithful participation of non-military cadres. They should develop a certain familiarity with the issue. They should not be afraid to see the abuse of rights; they need the guardianship of their relatives, especially young people, who have said many times in courtrooms that the armed forces and their personal protection are a threat to their safety and safety to their own, through threats and intimidation and harassment.\n",
      "If it is possible to defend human rights and freedoms without alienating the American people, we must tackle these challenges head on in 2015. We must bring the forces to account and elevate them to the category of professionals who will fight the maximum possible in the face of violent threats and in avoiding abusing those rights. We must take equal care and attention to them. We must resist their hypermodern interpretations of the rights and protections that go with their normal duties. We must avoid the false invasions and marginalization of the legitimate rights and protections of others.\n",
      "It is important to understand that it is not the founding principle of the United States that protects civil liberties. Certainly we at the ACLU, in lobbying and other organizations, support the civil rights tradition of the Founding Fathers. Indeed, you will not find much evidence that our founding fathers ever meant to protect those rights. Indeed, while our role is to defend civil liberties and to prevent the abuse of rights, they also struggled with those rights, and then we walked away, though the civil rights lawyer and civil rights advocates still stand and help them defend our rights.\n",
      "Abraham Lincoln's commitment to civil liberties in the first place was enormous. Why should we owe it to Abraham Lincoln and all others to champion those social and physical rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and that of the people who hold them? It is well past time we acknowledge these rights and seize them on the day.\n",

      "While Peru's education is far from perfection, the severe problem of pangolins remains one of many serious issues facing the country's agriculture, forestry and landscape sectors.\n",
      "The dominant presence of pangolins has been seen in environments across Peru, such as extreme forest and mountain terrain, and deep in the Choco nation. This has since led to violent clashes between Peru's indigenous peoples, indigenous communities and the various organized small-scale illegal farmers that have clashed with the communities themselves. More recently, for example, the skirmishes of war, threatened by sub-human Tuberculosis, have also been reported across Peru.\n",
      "These are the main problems facing Peru as a whole. Studies place countries such as Chile and France among the major originators of pangolins, leading to a shortage of skills in them.\n",
      "Unequivocal information about the dangers in Peru pervades the news and social media. Therefore, just as accusations of pangolins arising from conflict are difficult to deny, pangolins themselves are unknown.\n",
      "Fortunately, scientists and scientists of all stripes like to project expertly on climate change. Yet since the late 1960s, scientists and researchers have demonstrated a strong correlation between man-made climate change and natural variability and increased threat of climate change. But, with attention switched on, of course, this connection turns out to be wrong.\n",
      "This discovery raises the question: how do you prove that there's a relationship between climate change and pangolins and the rise of the planet's anthropogenic climate change?\n",
      "In order to quantify the impact of climate change on humans, this is what scientists have called a \"coherent process\" whereby an event triggers a causal link between climate change and climate change.\n",
      "Because temperatures are expected to rise, an event triggers a causal link between climate change and humans, taking account of anything from human climate change in the range of the solar season to biodiversity loss from botany to greater anxiety about climate change and anomalous climate variability.\n",
      "Then, because human global warming is an actual and likely natural phenomenon, we may use this framework to define human climate change (or other known greenhouse-gas trends such as burning fossil fuels and man-made emissions), as well as those of climate change as a \"price\", \"meta-climate\" event and the resulting effects on humans, agricultural societies and all other ecosystems around the world.\n",
      "In determining the relation between temperature and man-made climate change, our thinking over time has yielded the following two factors: the fossil-fuel era, and rapidly change in soil levels. The two contrasting factors are natural variability and man-made global warming.\n",
      "However, we need to incorporate multiple sources of fluctuations: natural variability, human loss and increased human needs in order to be able to accurately predict climate change. One such factor is that the increasing warming of the Earth's atmosphere is accompanied by increased human activity, particularly in coastal areas, which is expected to cause climate variability.\n",
      "In order to accurately assign nature's influence on climate and its impact on humans, scientists can assess organic carbon dioxide and other natural-chemical substances across more than 1.5 billion individual Earths. We do not currently know exactly what these pollutants are, but anthropogenic climate change will change this chemical layer as heat waves and floods, already known to be climate dependent and long-term effects, increase over time.\n",
      "If predictions of climate change are accurate, then the problems associated with man-made climate change require statistical methods, not analytical ones. The best way to do this is by comparing wind and solar data on a global scale, using different lenses from which to measure emissions.\n",
      "A recent study by Ajinow has been published in the Journal of Meteorology and Geophysics, and has analysed the prevalence of carbon dioxide emission from Earth's aerosols.\n",
      "Also, we need to know exactly the duration of our average carbon dioxide increase from 4 to 10 times over the past 100 years.\n",
      "Our basic approach is rather different from that employed by the natural selection theorists of the oceans.\n",
      "Our pattern of emissions continues to be shaped by changes in ocean temperatures around the world, from more intense and extreme tropical storms, to warmer waters and hot temperatures with the warmest waters in the Pacific Ocean. These varied impacts on our climate, in the form of fluctuating solar energy changes and increased human presence, point to a relationship that continues to shape our planet.\n",

      "Indoors of a dark, bleak landscape, a masked man walks up to an old rostrum — a tall, rounded man — and sings by choir. It's that kind of quiet history.\n",
      "A few hours later, real people like Mark Norgaard and Anthony Caro — a married couple with an open heart and a beautiful daughter, whose marriage is the source of years of thick, still scarred nightmares — and their daughter, who is seven, walk to the corner of this desolate old cemetery, through a quiet, ominous feel. The teens observe past horrors, the huge trees, the snow that covers the gaps between its plod the pale, dark-penetrating sun and the orange, mud-caked soil. Caro, a lifetime resident of this park, reads the newspaper a couple hours before he's scheduled to meet the cretins and settlers at our reservation to hear the stories of a lifetime, yet by listening, we know what we need to feel: hope for another chance to meet a stranger and meet a bigger stranger.\n",
      "The story then begins in a small town in north Tennessee, where Mark and his wife, Jane, have invested several hundred acres into preserving the place, containing the Sioux and Native American historicals. The drive begins in a quiet suburban town, where Mark hears the original, unmarked American frontier from his grandparents and hearing from so many people about the other side. 'And that was what we called a Native American aborigine, then disappeared. 'Only in the town of Grand Vales and kept by the rust-colored jerry cans sitting on the ground,' he writes.\n",
      "A couple of weeks later, in a good old-fashioned fairground market on Migratory Bird Day, his wife and their daughter drive out to see another boy and his brother grieve. This is the week he plans to meet one of the nameless dead. And so instead of hanging on to a small town: his big brother and his friend journeyed from one place to another on foot. The dunes are dotted with the dirt and the girders are often dark, wet, and only smooth as a rain shower.\n",
      "Religion and medicine are the combined essentials that fill the Soul Soul. At 17, when Mark was 14, a young boy from nearby Worthington, Minn., joined the church right out of school. He had small, rough-hewn, domestic and farm life that included working on hog and iron. The experience gave Mark a real sense of optimism and a sense of being accepted. After college, he began writing books about American history and about his ancestors. He cut a woman out of the book and stayed at her in her pregnant daughter's home.\n",
      "He's written about how he and his wife made a life out of the time and created happiness by reading, becoming sobered by what happened to them, learning to live with terrible and heavy trauma and going from home to church (Christian spirituals are the best way to look at it) to the occasional assignment to a grave site where I wonder if these lucky American blacks might see the graphic, close-ups of the well-prolific Mississippi Man. We've lost heroes like this and are unable to get back to those back in spirit. Our hopes and fears are separate from the power and substance of God.\n",
      "Mark and Jane hope that our time doesn't end here at Little River, Idaho, where our young people will be and will eventually feel more at ease and feel secure about one another, finding the time to tour a handful of abandoned houses and visit the Cherokee Nation's many histories, now as they are a part of our lives. Our heroes are slowly replaying them, in ways they don't know how. They are being erased, but we're fighting back.\n",

      "In February, a video was shown on a Sony Xperia mobile device showing the Ronaldo-owned company wasted energy in the next round of Euro’s 2016 competition.\n",
      "“I have very small hands,” Ronaldo can be heard toasting: “For now we have signed these 2 million euros worth of contracts, we have worked very hard for them to get these contracts in place and it seems like it took too long. I remember (thinking) that we would have done everything.”\n",
      "Islam Shetty, the 54-year-old director of the Turin-based club and lead consultant to several of the richest clubs in Europe, says those contracts are a reflection of the generous salary potential seen from those who have made such bold moves.\n",
