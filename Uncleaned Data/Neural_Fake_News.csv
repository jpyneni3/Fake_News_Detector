0,Trump extends federal social distancing guidelines to April 30,"['President Donald Trump, on his first official state visit to the U.S., said Tuesday he extends the “youth distancing” rule that forbids public officials from publicly endorsing any candidate for office.\nSpeaking at a breakfast with reporters ahead of the inauguration of his son, Donald Trump Jr., the president and first lady often refer to the bans on public officials openly urging supporters to cast their votes for the favored candidate. But there was no legal requirement for such outreach, Trump told reporters.\nThe president complained Tuesday that public officials, who do not have a voting record, “could” have had their dissembling relayed to them by private groups “if they thought it would become public.”\nHe emphasized that this is what he told House and Senate Republicans when they finally voted to ban the Trump family’s presidential campaign from using the party’s website to solicit donations.\n“They now have to go out and bring in the Congressional Enquirer, and the American people are telling them that there is no campaign, and the adulterers, the dishonest the guilty, with the racist and the outrageous the guilty,” he said.\nTrump earlier Tuesday announced he was ending the national social distancing rules that govern presidential candidates’ fundraising and policy speeches. A total of 17 presidential candidates already have declared their support for them during his first days in office, and the public just announced it in December.\nThursday is the two-day inauguration of his son, who has said his father, who entered the White House as a boy from India, would run for president. Trump is to participate in the official swearing-in ceremony.\nMost of his campaign’s funding comes from donations from private donors. Even while he kept most of the money in the bank, he has restricted himself from volunteering in the White House.\nIn a separate broadcast interview, Trump told several reporters that he’s “very proud” of being the first son to run as an independent candidate.\nWhen pressed by reporters by CNN White House correspondent Jorge Ramos about his intention to run for president, Trump said, “The thing about Donald is that I’m very proud to be running.”\nAt the breakfast, Trump also told reporters that he will soon be exiting the ambassador’s residence at Trump Tower in New York and said he was “excited” to see the president-elect, the first son to enter the White House.\nJorge Ramos\n']"
1,"Coronavirus live updates: Global pandemic kills more than 30,000","['By Dylan Welch\nApril 1, 2015. (Bloomberg) -- From an outbreak of an intestinal worm to an epidemic of vaccine-resistant leukodystrophy disease in Africa, a global vaccine campaign has killed a significant number of people worldwide.\nThis year’s vaccine campaign, launched last year and financed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was the world’s third largest ever. The campaign is in danger of losing its support in Congress with few health-care exceptions.\nThe new Global Vaccine Surveillance Organization (GI-VSO) has around 2000 participants, with an annual budget of around $60 million. International, homegrown and local organization members issue vaccination alerts, while assistance from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which makes up the international organization, checks the data for Vaccine Complaints and Vaccine Use by geographic origin.\nI got vaccinated last month in a few different ways -- not to give anecdotal reading of foreign agents but to determine whether the disease could be a problem with the vaccines produced in the United States.\nAn individual vaccineshot: Where can I get one at home? – https://t.co/eYJPaqEn4Gm — Rungenur Billerdy (@RungenurBillerdy) March 4, 2019\nA large part of the U.S. had experienced no safety concerns in the current year. But nations in West Africa, Asia and the Middle East are most at risk. For example, just from Jan. 2, 2018, Guinea had nine deaths in vaccine-resistant leukodystrophy, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe current vaccine campaign has cost $60 million; $16 million of that has come from Congress.\nWhy don’t you know how many were vaccinated? – https://t.co/rOcbrOAJRA #3rdAnnualVMPSshot pic.twitter.com/YTXglRvvDE — Congressional HIV subcommittee (@RepJonathanLoC) February 2, 2019\nIt may seem obvious that it’s not vaccine-resistant that is killing so many people, but by controlling the spread of leukodystrophy, management of the disease isn’t. And although many nations have a history of failure to combat the disease (such as Latin America’s cholera epidemic in the 1980s and ’90s), others are doing things differently than that in case the virus reaches the U.S. and infects many patients. Some countries have simply stopped vaccinating people or blocked access to foreign medicines. Countries in the Zika virus outbreak also prohibit the importation of vaccines to help prevent this outbreak.\n“Vaccination is a key component of protecting children,” said Tiffany Alabrete, senior research associate at the Atlanta-based Center for Disease Control and Prevention. “If we don’t find the right vaccine from a manufacturer, we will have a global pandemic, so vaccines are especially important.”\n']"
2,"Trump concedes US coronavirus death toll could be 100,000 or more","['Donald Trump won his home state of California on Sunday in landslides and expensive government subsidies that he has pledged to support.\nThe moribund death toll from the deadliest coronavirus in history could rise to 100,000 or more, according to the latest estimate from a White House study, with 48 Canadians likely to die from the disease, and 13 Americans dead in Mexico.\nTrump told reporters at a briefing in the White House that the estimate, which includes victims in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico and Romania, would be “worrisome.”\n“We know we have two senators in California. We have three other senators that would be very hard to beat. I mean, this is going to be a lot of difficult votes.”\nHe said he was “optimistic that we will have a lot of good folks down in this region. It’s a very difficult place.”\nHe warned Canada and Australia, too, that the total number of deaths in their countries could exceed 100,000.\n“Obviously it’s horrible because it’s literally a one-off,” Trump said, invoking the name of his $1 billion campaign for an Ebola vaccine.\nBut he insisted he would do whatever was necessary to ensure there was “a more affordable, convenient, safe vaccine.”\nTrump echoed complaints from thousands of people in the states affected by his initiatives, saying he did not consider any of those states unsafe.\nThe Trump administration is reportedly working with the Democratic party, organized labor and other organisations to organize around its plans for dealing with a coronavirus outbreak, although no specific recommendations have been made to combat it, according to CNN.\nThe White House announced the results of a yearlong analysis, detailed in the report, that reveals evidence of the coronavirus’s devastating impacts to California.\n“These findings make clear that the accelerated deployment of the (the product) remains robust and should have no immediate impact on California health and public safety,” the report said.\n“It is our expectation that new ballplayers will come to California, especially those playing college football and their international counterparts.”\n']"

4,Donald Trump's special day,"['The wish of many in the press was for the morning President to do some Facebook stalking, stories he’d spread about Jon Stewart, his political strategies, and special projects, before the next TV show in the works.\nBut no such luck. Standing on the platform, as he did during his speech about Senator Ted Cruz, Trump might recall being a mere few seconds ago.\nThe significance of his state’s name marks a big victory for his political opponents in Texas. It marks the first time that anyone has elected a Republican as president of any state since 1890. The state has a “national integrity and solid reputation” that lags behind his New Hampshire rivals.\nHe mocked Texas’ governor, Ted Cruz, in the biggest dig at any Republican this year — at Texas and Perry. He attacked the free market for failed solutions to end Obamacare and make sure that Sarah Palin gets elected governor. One joke after another about Trump’s “party in the trenches,” adding that Cruz’s use of Social Security and Medicare to fund his education-free college educations was a Twitter fave.\nNo news has “immediately” become reported.\n']"
5,How long will Trump's poll surge last?,"['California — With 2 million new registered voters, the Trump candidacy is one of the most impressive political gaffes in years. On April 1, he exceeded expectations by more than 5,000. Republicans are suffering from their largest number of Democrats on record. In third place was Indiana.\nAfter years of dismal turnout, the lead in California fell to barely one person, with Trump taking a 6.1 percent lead over Clinton. Well ahead of the former secretary of state were Kim Kardashian West and Nicki Minaj.\nCalifornia is a home to thousands of mostly young people who all vote and it appears they will be crucial in November’s elections.\nMeanwhile, many newly elected voters in other states are expected to drop off the rolls. In 11 states, young people face an uphill climb.\nDavid Samson, a Los Angeles lawyer and GOP consultant who was tapped to manage congressional campaigns for Donald Trump, and Neil Abercrombie, a Harvard professor, are two Republicans who want to emulate Trump’s campaign and Democrats. They have promised to “do what Donald Trump did for a living,” pledge Trump to “punish crimes in America,” and will look to lead the economy.\n“The African-American demographic — women, young, Latino — is big, but not as big as Trump’s demographic effect,” Samson wrote in a column the next morning. “Obama in 2008 was a struggle because of the unusually large population of black voters in the ’60s and ’70s and, more recently, the Latin voting population. Trump would represent a vastly lower-turnout GOP vote than Obama.”\nAbercrombie appears to agree. In an interview with The Washington Post, he expressed the hope that Trump could get all of the 6.1 million voters to go to the polls.\n“If he can build that voting base by not alienating Latino voters,” he said, “I would have some friends who get voting.”\nAbercrombie went on to suggest that if Trump won that turnout could reach the “tw-tw-tw-tw” trend since the Obama era. Trump needed to win more voters to cast a ballot and probably it’s not going to happen, which is the world we live in now.\n“We are in a world where we don’t care about the fate of the economy or our citizens,” he wrote. “We are in a world where we have a president who tells us he will do everything in his power to assure a good life for us.”\nIn what is an unusual placement, California’s primary is held on April 1.\nThe race for California’s 6th Congressional District was in a tie because of controversies surrounding Rep. Edward Markey, the former congressman. Rep. Jerrold Nadler was also an upstart Democratic candidate; there were no Republicans.\nMarkey won it by 26 percent to 40 percent. But an uncounted 0.9 million votes were cast after Markey beat out Markey, who had registered at least 56 percent support as of Jan. 30.\nDespite Markey’s victory, Democrats lament how strange the general election is. Instead of a runoff, it’s a tie. Without that tie, with most Republicans out in California on April 1, the long-running campaigns would be a sleepy run-in.\nMany Republicans have something to back up their argument that Trump is helping Republicans win — Democrats may well do it.\n']"
6,A breakdown of false and misleading statements at Trump Rose Garden briefing,"['A pair of Washington Post reporters get personal updates from the president of a federal agency.\nTrump told reporters at the Rose Garden Wednesday he was personally worried about issuing emails and directing people not to fill out campaign forms as part of the voter registration blitz in the 2016 election.\nTrump said he was in no rush to proceed but said he\'s even writing an amendment to a bill that would make it easier for the FBI to spy on Trump\'s supporters as part of a broader intelligence overhaul.\nAsked about the email scandal involving Trump associate, Donald Trump Jr., Spicer said the president and his inner circle were ""too slow to do this.""\nAmong Trump\'s regulations for businesses, the Trump Organization website would be redesigned to allow business owners and lobbyists to disclose information publicly without obstructing the Internal Revenue Service.\nHe continued to say the regulations would be born out of last year\'s Senate confirmation process for a judge to replace former federal judge and a CIA Director.\nSpicer rejected a suggestion of ethics problems, explaining that past conflicts of interest could be avoided if business owners and lobbyists knew they could hire Trump lobbyists.\nHe suggested it was a ""risk"" to switch over to business owners now that their lobbying clients are openly hiding voter information and dealing with legislative changes to strengthen the administration.\nAmid questions about the emails, Trump said the president was joking when asked about former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.\n']"
7,New York coronavirus deaths soar past 960 as New Rochelle's 'Patient Zero' goes home,"['As the death toll rises across New York City, a new type of infection known as RSV appears to be the biggest cause.\nAn eruption of the coronavirus — which is contracted in the flannel shirt of a baby — is already spreading around the city, including death among children.\nThe Bronx’s infamous New Rochelle 2 has already received more than 9,000 cases of the recent strain that it infects now, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\nThe New Rochelle 3 among about 98,000 cases was identified as a clear sign that the deadly cholera virus is more prevalent on the affluent borough than originally thought, the agency said. A total of 291 cases were confirmed in the Bronx on April 1 alone, and 129 out of 241 people diagnosed with RSV were under 5 years old.\nElvin D. McMarr, New Rochelle’s director of health and emergency preparedness, said the city’s public health department has set a goal to take as many as 1,000 new cases into effect before the entire population in the city is added to the 100,000 figure.\n“We can’t hide in the unknown,” he said. “This is going to be a tremendous boost for the public health.”\nOne reason for the increase in cases has been a — as the CDC put it — “strategic” shift in newborns. Earlier this year, CDC officials estimated that at least 79 babies were born in NY in 2018, with about half of them infected during a flu season. Those babies were spread by DNA from hospital residents on New Year’s Eve to their mothers on New Year’s Day, the CDC noted.\nAn effective vaccine is still needed for the current outbreak to be fully confirmed, however. If the current outbreak spreads beyond New Rochelle and across all of the boroughs, epidemiologist Kelly Dumisley said, “we want to see this confirmed.”\nSuch trends have become increasingly common among other deaths on the New York City East Side, the fifth-largest city in the country, the agency said. A separate report from the city’s public health department in January found that the city had for the first time reported the most cases of so-called competitive diseases — such as measles and mumps — in New York in 2018. The city’s five vaccination districts — Briarwood, Pearl, Roosevelt, North and East Village — reported an average of 339 cases each in 2018, the report showed.\nEven though the city’s public health department is confident that the RVs cause no serious infection, those numbers carry a huge margin of error.\nAn outbreak of RSV-related diseases on New York’s South Side in 1957 made it difficult for authorities to track, a situation blamed on outbreaks across the South Side and adjacent areas. Before this outbreak, when people at lower levels of the risk were also exposed to the virus, they died of it.\nSOURCE: Health and Human Services Department | PHOTO CREDIT: Getty\nSEE ALSO:\nHospital Battle For Sick Families Discussed As Scientists Introduce ‘Baby Rx’\n10 Signs Of Plague Around New York City This Year\n']"

The family attributed her sudden illness to complications at her hospital in Santa Barbara.\nIn a statement about Mercader’s cause of death, Erica Guro, a former NBC News reporter who taught me journalism, said the unexpected illness had not been reported before at the Coronavirus Allergy Conference, which was held in May 2016.\n“I cannot express how well our friends have handled it all, and I’m grateful for everyone who have prayed for our mother, who had already revealed that she will be missed,” Guro said in a statement.\nMercader was “devastated” over the time she spent with family and friends who were unaware of the illness, as well as the sheer volume of illnesses that had sickened relatives and medical professionals, she said. “I love you too, Maria,” she told a gaggle of reporters.\nMercader, who was born in Panama City, said in a previous interview with NBC, that she had developed the plague and was eating methamphetamines. The plague had a global gene mutation that makes it turn out that the virus is likely prevented by keeping the cells as “autoclaved” by the virus itself. “They would remove all the peptides and recombinant copy of the virus, and it would just re-end the gene in a way that turned the virus to heroin,” she told the Los Angeles Times in 2013. “I was sick, and I knew I’d die.”\nGuro, who was born in Aspen, Colorado, in 1942, said her mother had one more lung infection in her 20s, and remained ill for months, but not long after she died. “My mother lost all three of her lungs, and her lungs were gaping,” she said. “A week ago I was on the fritz. That’s the mark of a mother.”\nIn 2015, her mom claimed cancer had returned, according to The New York Times.\nMercader’s friends and colleagues have said they were shocked by the sudden death. Erica Guro noted that even though her mother had developed pneumonia a few weeks before she died, she was not familiar with it and reported symptoms from her small size to her doctor, she said.\nGuro’s colleague, Nigel Sinclair, recalled seeing the woman with a face with her arms in left eye. She said she called her cellphone and tried to confirm the passing on her mother’s Facebook friend list.\n']"

11,"9 takeaways from Tapper's interviews with Pelosi, Fauci, de Blasio and more","['Ten takeaways from Tapper\'s Oct. 9 op-ed piece ""So Clear Is the Gilead Of Political Events That Make Control Better""?\n1. Pelosi, Gilead, de Blasio set to meet with congressmen on Thursday, and both Democrats and Republicans are looking to use the session to highlight aspects of Pelosi\'s party that are easier to talk about than they would do on another subject (preferably insider-trading).\n2. It\'s a day for politics. House Democrats spent a lot of time asking questions during this week\'s conference call for all 30 House Republicans, with no — and as I noted Tuesday — debates dominating the agenda during each of the retreat sessions. Meanwhile, Gilead\'s speaker, Larry Hogan, is concentrating his attention on running against Vice President Mike Pence, and by the end of the Republican conference call, Hogan may be in.\n3. We\'ll hear stories from the dinner guests Tuesday night, including Faith Evans of FarmTown Media and Chief Operating Officer Bob Sanders, and families like Paul and Linda DeStefano of Allstate (and Freestate\'s Hugoshen mother).\n4. It\'s a rare Friday afternoon for the Senate\'s 69-member group of senators, most of whom have been seen on Friday waiting for the news to get in. They\'ll gather at 6 p.m. on the Senate floor for the formal briefing -- since there isn\'t a full-time State of the Union -- and go to the White House briefing for Air Force One, where Gilead CEO Gavin McInnes will be gathering intel on progress to be made in the midterm election.\n5. When the head of Rep. Eric Cantor is speaking in New Hampshire today, we\'ll hear how Cantor, the Republican whip in the House, has spent most of his conference phone session spending his time with the congressman apologizing to Cantor for his presence in his caucus. ""Thank you for your help. We\'re making this right now. We need your help. You\'ll get in here soon, and we\'re going to come meet you again,"" Cantor said.\n6. Gilead may be paying attention to as long as the media is picking it up. The company\'s second-largest shareholder, telecommunications company Verizon, tweeted on Friday that it was ""aware"" of the budding culture of leaks in the media. Gilead stock is down sharply following the Bloomberg report.\n7. When US Sen. Jon Tester was putting together a pre-inaugural action plan for the House of Representatives, he came across a draft that seemed to fall into something of the Internet mongering season artifice typical of the media\'s coverage of the lame duck session. Meanwhile, Tester\'s wife and daughter made a link to the draft\'s page on the Internet.\n8. Eric Cantor lost the vote on the Hill Wednesday, all while picking up votes in California to finish a woefully antiquated health care bill. That\'s unusual, given that most political observers expect a version of the bill to be passed by the end of the year.\n9. There were reportedly more stories concerning sexual harassment at the Capitol this week than usual, including when officials started seeing an altered version of a report about how Neiman Marcus used its brands on ""provocative"" new storefront spaces. The best news was that Breitbart senior staff writer, Greg Sargent, resigned from his position Tuesday.\nBut, for the most part, we\'re back to the Capitol instead of the Atlantic City resort. Journalists joined a seemingly unfruitful, slightly facile ""Social Security advisory council"" (which gave you all the signs of a president again) to meet with lawmakers. This is almost a dozen days into the annual congressional calendar, and when either of those titbits of legislative concern aren\'t available, there\'s no reason to believe things won\'t start turning increasingly rowdy in the coming days.\nJoin us for a live audio clip from all of Tapper\'s interviews with two of the House newcomers to talk about their important roles in American politics and Washington.\nSubscribe to National Politics Briefing on Facebook or watch the blog here.\n']"

13,Coronavirus preys on what terrifies us: dying alone,"['Christmas opens in June and it’s too late to celebrate the festive season. The polo ball is the sickest. The worrying trend: people using organised fashion for hair cuts are exploiting a disease that can be recreated in a ghastly way.\nIt’s an important disease to explore and it gives people much-needed answers to a topic a twinkle in their eye. If love couldn’t cure schizophrenia, schizophrenia might as well kill itself: it’s an added wrinkle in a conversation with your partner and you won’t be shocked if their morning over. But while it’s easy to eliminate odd situations, it can cause anxiety and even psychological harm. Research has found that the “leftovers” in the womb have a high risk of causing cancer or the death of those living with the syndrome. People who’ve had a cold for several weeks can have 20 per cent more blood loss in their bodies than those who’ve not had one.\nIt’s certainly a good idea to plan for the challenges ahead. The NHS recommends health staff carefully screen young people, particularly those who are at risk of a disease like that requiring infection. Thanks to techniques such as travel agencies and black box scans, doctors can retrieve vital files at the right time to help people manage a patient’s illness.\nI’ve never envisaged travel agents turning up unannounced after Christmas with their unwrapped wristbands and plan alerts, but finding all these answers to “send me a message” is a joy. But then it’s not always possible, especially during times of peace and relaxation. To rescue your brain from the temptations of driving a hot iron might simply take bravery and, more importantly, judgement. When will you realise you’re lonely?\nNow and again, the elderly have better theories, besides being amazed that their brains are programmed to churn out witty answers to questions. I’m not sure I want to think of putting you in a hospital down to discuss the pros and cons of each day in The Sun. Confidence is endangered. Everyone is on the edge, but we all do. At the end of the day, it’s not about building a job, especially not once you see a smile in a crowded room. For those who can’t control the forces of a loved one or complain about out-of-shape colleagues, they will watch in dismay.\nRead more: Why patients must not forget they have two brains\nTake for example patient admission data from University College London, which I blogged about in my column in January. Over 200 people in the survey had their applications for the top job in a hospital. Their diagnosis, the fund-raising, the dignified admissions, attitude and volunteering options were all supplied. One in four had the words “when I became sick” pinned on their phone during the waiting lists. More than two-thirds of those had attracted a lot of positive comments about the manager, even after illness had taken its toll. My main complaint: that it was unfair to offer your first job interview with an unreasonable workload.\nThis was partly to allow the 10,000 participants, the first cohort, to get over their mental trauma. One reason why doctors are finding it difficult to distinguish between welcome, on the contrary, ill behavior and working with people who don’t meet the criteria for a job interview is simply because many are influenced by their own social status.\nThe burden is being borne by patients but they are not the only ones. Adults with two or more failed ones also face dreadful problems. Given the dire state of current policy, even ambitious young people are starting to complain about doctors who resort to accept the view that they are not required to open their brain a regular check-up. If you’re too busy worrying about the HIV crisis and that night at the cinema, you won’t find time to look down at a poster advertising an unlicensed self-cancelling drug that’s used to give Viagra to minors.\nYet despite some relief, many of the busy folks who are most likely to attend this class still don’t feel well enough to take the time to get a proper diagnosis. Like me, many can’t and don’t believe that they need a miracle cure to survive. But this needs to be the final straw for the ordinary. Treating others with a changing brain or a double-abdominal is not the answer.

17,John Callahan of TV show 'All My Children' dead at 66,"['The lovely John Callahan, known as “Fairy Lady” on the hit ITV soap, died March 29, according to her publicist. She was 66.\nJohn Callahan, the beloved TV legend who played the titular character with legendary roles in the 2005 movie Mary Queen of Scots and Vikings, died March 29 after suffering an irregular heartbeat, according to an extended statement on the show’s Facebook page.\nThe Nottingham playwright was a wild actor, a literal “brat load” (as he frequently memorably put it), and a gifted citizen. She was also one of TV’s most enduring and beloved figure when it came to sitcoms and special master. She hosted “All My Children” and was awarded an Emmy award for her 1957 play “Guevara As the Family Man.” Callahan was the first main character to lose her marbles and left “All My Children” to nurse her child. She “lived and worked many a long and unfulfilled and wonderful life,” along with her longtime sister, who died shortly after.\nHeather Condon, author of “All My Children” and a former St. Patrick’s Day journo, reported the news of her death on her website. She thanked him, her successor as a beloved Frisbee player. “My heart breaks for the dearly loved John Callahan,” she said. “He was a splendid, wonderful, terrific writer and friend, a tremendous, wonderful director, and of course a wonderfully selfless person. My fondest memories of him were of hearing him proclaim, ‘That cat still won!’”\nHeather Condon recalled that her “Liz McGuinness” character would often poke her head in the direction of her nemesis, when she was five. “Those times, being so open and airy, we needed to shut ourselves up for a very, very long time. He was … just so good,” she said. “He would stand there in front of me and say, ‘I just woke up.’ That was the one with the way he wanted to play. He would tease me. There was something about being the other person that you’d really want to be with.”\n“I would always say he [the fictional Dean] ‘taught me what I need to do.’ He would just be so forthright and mean, so very honest. It was a really nice place to be,” she continued. “He taught me that good things happen when you go through tough times and when you get a little bit lucky, or a little bit unlucky. I loved him so much.”\nPer his obituary, his love of storytelling was “always of the utmost importance”. “He knew how to write and I loved him so much that no matter what you thought about him, he could always find you a way,” the tragedy report reads. “That’s why being an ‘Outcast’ was so much fun. With his politics, his laugh and his humanity, John took it everywhere he went and transformed it into an anachronism.”\nJohn Callahan and his fellow Irish sons (Iain, Nicholas, Peter) and John Thame, whose house were built in Dublin in 1953, were set to remain alive and well on the show through the end of the show’s 25th season. They will be sorely missed by fans of their characters, who will forever be gifted with a lasting respect for their characters. We greatly extend our prayers to their mother and to their family.\n']"
18,"Amazon workers to stage a walkout Monday, demanding closure of Staten Island facility","['Moments before they walked out, Staten Island Local 484 held a walkout at Amazon’s North Shore plant. The walkout aims to show some employees who closed the facility in March, when it was shut down, that Amazon is investing in cleaning up its black market operations and will be allowed to reopen in the future.\nThe five-mile walkout would start at 8:30 a.m. and ends at 7 p.m. on Mondays. The Staten Island plan to speak out online and on social media, including on Twitter and Facebook, to promote the strike.\nAlex Pincus is vice president of News Source Source. When asked about the walkout, he explained the strike is about bringing benefits and economic development together.\n""We believe that this is a group of people who understand the impacts and limitations of the millions of dollars spent annually in this practice of churning out over $22 billion in subsidized consumer goods at this location, especially at a low-wage employer in a very saturated market,"" Pincus said.\nUnder the post-detailed terms of the agreement, Amazon agreed to reduce wages in the dispute, allowed a new contract to be finalized in the summer and halt construction of its Troy facility. The company is also said to have agreed to trade paid holidays to employees.\nThe Workers World Party estimates that the current Wall Street workforce of about 67,000 workers in the 250,000-square-foot plant will need to work another 90 hours each week for the foreseeable future.\nMembers of several unions, including the working dog, drivers\' club and teachers, have already stepped up their own boycott campaign in protest of the closure of the plant, which employs more than 300 people. Local 484, which represents local shopworkers, said its members plan to reach out to Amazon workers in Staten Island and elsewhere, raising awareness about the problem to its website.\n""It\'s something that has to be addressed, so we can pull together and see who else is doing what,"" said Mickey Bradley, a union representative. ""They should listen to our side. If they come forward, it won\'t get their attention, we won\'t get their attention and we won\'t sign up, but then we have to ask them why we\'re starting this.""\nGet the Breaking News newsletter!

Matthew Stamenkovsky, regional director of the Empire State Development Authority, in a tweet on Monday said that he could not explain the offer by Amazon to provide store and restaurant workers one week notice in return for a new contract. Stamenkovsky said that delivery workers are represented by unions representing Amazon workers in New York and other states.\n""At this facility you need service personnel who are employed by Amazon,"" Stamenkovsky wrote. ""They are sometimes meeting in the same restroom. When customers arrive, everyone has a chance to tip the owner. And they can\'t do it without running many search and service locators. There are no promised lifetime pay reductions, no additional hours until a new employee starts working full time. Any other pay increases that are offered would be accretive to the company\'s ongoing bottom line. Plus, the management will pay increasing wages, benefits and other benefits despite the change in the workforce. Our union pays her wages and benefits fairly.""\nOn Monday, the Staten Island workers camped out on the streets ahead of the planned walkout, CBS-6 reported. They want a ""no-excuses"" job, 401(k) retirement plan, location and paid leave for new hires. With some employees absent from work due to illness, they said that Amazon is setting a bad precedent by letting out managers like Rothstein for strike dates.\n“They’re not giving us anything we’re not used to,” Cindy Stump, a local school custodian, told WCBS-TV. She said her son, David Stump, needed to see more nursing staff.\n“We’re a lot happier than losing pay for the first time,” she added.\nAmazon has been one of the industries spun off in the $32 billion merger between Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Kraft Foods Inc. But it closed the one-million-square-foot subsidiary in Providence, R.I., less than 24 hours after the Whole Foods unit left for Amazon\'s global fulfillment center. It has reopened, and said last week that the plant is moving forward.\n']"

That was linked to ice, which was discovered during testing of the store’s glass at a restaurant.\nPolice say the increased surveillance starts Monday.\n“We will have our checkpoints as a way to enhance our community screening and driving enforcement capabilities,” spokesman Ted Korychalk said in a statement.\nA refresher course will be used in other checkpoints, though later states that they have not been expanded.\n']"

At the very least, it would be different.”\n“I think that’s a very safe forecast,” the official said.\nSpeaking in the US state of California, the Trump administration said on Thursday Mr Trump was “very serious” about the country’s “difficult problem” with China.\nMr Trump is campaigning for his second term in office and his remarks on Monday show his determination to try to improve relations with the country, which he says is a way to further assert US influence in the region.\nBut the United States is poised to take the lead role in East Asia – perhaps its main strategic competition with China, potentially as it considers how to grapple with international challenges.\nIn a wide-ranging interview with Washington Post television on Tuesday, Mr Trump sought to differentiate the U.S. from the West.\n“We’re aggressive and we’re trading with,” Mr Trump said. “We don’t want to bring them in here. We want to partner with them. I said, don’t ask us to be great, because we’re not great. But we’re going to do something really good.”\nBut within the administration, some experts say Mr Trump may have hit the side of the road too hard on trade with the region.\nAs on previous occasions, he has relied on interpreters as well as negotiators – a practice that the White House says undermines credibility in trying to deal with a major crisis.\nUS Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer also voiced concerns last week about a “missing piece” in Mr Trump’s wooing the Pacific Rim.\nThe United States has been working with 10 Pacific Rim nations, most of them the region’s biggest economies, on a new trade pact that could be signed on 25 March, although the Trump administration is expected to rely more heavily on Pacific Rim countries rather than bilateral partners to pursue their own multilateral negotiations, according to US officials.\nThe talks are continuing and Mr Trump’s pressure for hard evidence is giving the skeptics nervous.\nOn Thursday, Mr Trump tweeted: “U.S. ag and oil workers are some of the top ag jobs in the world, so much so that they are being threatened.”\nBusiness lobby pressure seen as heading in the right direction despite Trump’s frustration with China\nMr Trump’s office said he had held consultations with several administration officials including director of national intelligence James Clapper, on how they would position America’s global interests should he adopt China’s aggressive trade policies.\nWhen the officials refused to share details of their meetings, Mr Trump attacked America’s record on trade with other countries as “rigged”.\n“I have a lot of issues on the table in China with regard to the trade with North Korea. I’ve been very clear since I took office, we’re going to treat those trade with the US that we really think are going to bring jobs and produce economic prosperity for all Americans,” he said.\nAfter a meeting with the Chinese president, Mr Trump said he was considering taking a harsher approach to the trade issue.\n“It would be very unfair for me to talk directly to any nation that wants to pay China for their trade surpluses. I don’t think that’s right,” Mr Trump said.\nMr Trump’s initial complaints about China’s economic growth led to the largest trade deficit since the Great Depression, Mr Trump said.\nThe US trade deficit has risen to $1.65 trillion since 2000, from $750 billion in 2001.\nThe tariff debate has deepened mistrust between China and the US over this issue, which has aggravated economic growth in recent years.\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP, REUTERS)\nDate created : 2020-04-01\n']"

It would restore a 0.3 percent payroll tax on Social Security, although most of the other taxes added would be scrapped under the plan — known as “benefits tax,” or BIT.\nMnuchin said the BIT could be eliminated if the U.S. Senate and U.S. Chamber of Commerce sign off on the framework, but he said that too many people would be at risk.\n""It\'s going to be disconcerting and it\'ll be miserable if it\'s not done,"" he said.\nBy Jack Cassellius, dpa The Financial Times contributed to this report.\n']"

25,These states have implemented stay-at-home orders. Here's what that means for you,"['This article is from the archive of our partner .\nParallels to the last time our government attempted to overturn a ban on military-style stay-at-home parental leave programs. While it\'s the rule that parents can\'t work or live on the job during the month of their child\'s birthday, the mandatory stay-at-home for those now in full-time employment suddenly turned the clock back (to sort of 4-1/2) and made many parents curious about the future of their newly-employed counterparts. These are the states which seem poised to enact stay-at-home parental leave programs at a pace that even everyone hates.\nDavid Cameron\'s Europe of Maloney, for example, will allow parents to collect their utilities free of charge and choose when and where they\'ll want their children\'s due dates — in other words, they can choose when to take their children. If you want to find out if your grown-up you want to prep kids for school — in other words, who can have your takeout as your baby — then you may want to consult other government-led programs. Davis didn\'t say explicitly what, but left the door open as to what would happen if a post-term stay-at-home order were enacted:\nThe day the notices were sent out in some states, it came up “that an area in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts would have the requirement that all children get a stay-at-home order from the public sector,” Davis said. “And he didn’t give any indication whether that would work in Connecticut or Minnesota.”\nIn what\'s left of the liberal world, the court is coming out in favor of a similar measure in Pennsylvania, with Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf vetoing it. A year ago, the Pennsylvania Legislature approved the stipend in the state’s charter, which stipulates that a parent can get one of two schedules of labor: a one-time interruption for 25 hours per week at one day a week for a minimum of two years and a four-year interruption for six. But the legislation now specifies that if state workers are required to serve dinner in their state (it\'s mandatory in Maine), they must be children of the state (and not employees of the Department of Children and Families) and may also be paid extra. Some businesses have already gone this way — such as the Dental and Plastic Surgery store in Marlborough, Massachusetts, which will soon go that route if one of its employees is not able to leave the store (unless they can get a job).\nChris Mays, who\'s just been hired by Lehigh University, was one of the original GoDoomes who signed onto the K-12 school full-time unpaid leave policy. He was with the school when lawmakers approved, and while he described living out of his case in Massachusetts ""all the way up,"" he nonetheless endorses the look on the kids’ faces and their parents’ mouths when they see a private order advising that they “shouldn’t have to take a job with their baby while on time.”\n']"
26,FDA authorizes 15-minute coronavirus test,"['The United States Food and Drug Administration has authorized a national registry of “vulnerabilities” in vaccines using a newer test aimed at preventing use by newborns, chronic infants and children born with flu-like illnesses such as pneumonia.\nAn international collaborative process to determine the number of bacterial infections could take up to a year, Dr. William Joaquin Irizarry, director of the vaccine development program at the FDA’s division of infectious diseases, said Tuesday in a statement.\nMany babies are born with impaired immune systems, helping to make vaccines difficult to prevent and provide protection against disease.\nPrevious vaccine responses that have since been developed with this new technique might affect either infants who are born with flu-like illnesses or children who have had an unusually mild flu season, but the new test uses one of three characteristics to identify a “vulnerability” of vaccines.\n“This will increase the need for FDA-approved development by one to five years,” Irizarry said in a statement. “We would like to support a national registry of infections and preventative vaccines.”\nBy developing a new type of vaccine—a mouthwash derived from shellfish whose vapors are different from eggs—the FDA hopes to avoid the unintended consequences of drugmakers reacting to bacterial infections in the hands of unsuspecting babies and infants.\nFor the survey and test, the agency planned to use its mobile scanner which collects three sheets of tissue compared to one for each sample of the test’s sample.\nThe scanner reports and collects the sample of all vaccine samples obtained from different samples of vaccine in various stages of development. Doctors periodically diagnose these infections and test whether vaccines pose a threat.\nThe administration also plans to test “vulnerabilities in vaccines” to discover the number of vaccine infections this month and next year.\nThe current use of traditional vaccines, such as human papillomavirus (HPV), is almost entirely deregulated under a longstanding agreement signed by the U.S. government in 1993.\nThe new vaccine test will be called VCC-1594 and make it available beginning in May and Sept. 6.\nThe test looks at “vulnerabilities of vaccines” in the risk of becoming vaccine-tainted by severe illness or vaccine failures, and a database of vaccines that has been used for this purpose has been created.\nThe team behind the vaccine test, developed at the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, is based at Stanford University School of Medicine and includes Stanford medical school microbiologist Professor Torsten Flanger and UCSF experts Alison Cox and professor Katie Leust (illustrated in Nature Communications, April 1, 2018) and Lisa Laing (illustrated in Nature Communications, April 10, 2018).\nRelated:\n']"

28,Disneyland and Walt Disney World to remain closed because of coronavirus,"['Disney World and Disney’s other theme parks and resorts will stay closed because of a coronavirus, marking the beginning of a worldwide campaign to have the public and the media disclose information about coronavirus.\nThe number of cases — which includes children, teens and adults — is increasing each year at Walt Disney World. It ranks as the second most common per capita threat due to the presence of coronavirus.\nThe Epcot Health Center, the world’s largest coronavirus hub, and other health care organizations, would not say whether healthcare firms would work with Disney World or other theme parks to disclose data. Such an effort would be voluntary for now, said Dr. Annalise Collins, dean of the Johns Hopkins Department of Integrative Medicine.\n“There have been children cases of our coronavirus that have been very mild, and also, we would hope that companies would be honest, say, ‘We haven’t made any announcements about the coronavirus,’ or ‘We haven’t given information about the coronavirus.’ ”\nClaudette Kellett, the director of the Epcot Health Center, said that while there have been reports that cases of coronavirus are rare, the virus has been in active use in patients. The outbreak has not affected anyone from the Walt Disney Company, she said.\n“We know it will be a longer-term issue with public disclosures, but we are hoping that companies would think twice about disclosing information that could cause harm to patients,” she said.\nDairy-dependent Epcot is among the first of the 40 theme parks and resorts to leave the cloud after the coronavirus outbreak, which occurred in September 2017. The last hospital stay for a tiger cub — the first for which formal names have yet to be announced — occurred in December 2016.\nAsked at the time how a company could keep a connection with the coronavirus, Eileen McHugh, the Disney World spokeswoman, replied: “Companies that use resorts to negotiate with guests are not harming anybody. Our health center and Epcot Health Center will not be harmed, and we respect the families of the individuals who were exposed to the virus.”\nMs. McHugh repeated the company’s stated confidence in her organization’s health.\nPublic health officials have warned that there are risks for children, teens and adults who come into contact with the virus — not only with animals, but also with direct contact with humans. That threat comes even as experts predict a new coronavirus that will pick up in poor sanitation.\nThe Epcot Health Center has set a 2 percent vaccination program for adults, with planned vaccinations in most locations until June 2020. It also plans to go out with a public health promotion — including an e-sphere and in-house alerts — that will emphasize “best practices and accurate use of key players in infectious disease control.”\nThe General Public Health Service of the United States, which created Epcot Health Center in 2009, has put out a call for public health leaders to contact regarding outbreaks. It has emphasized better hygiene measures, free food and guaranteed access to bottled water.\nBecca Johnson, the hospital’s assistant director of communication and facilities health, said it is “possible” that the disease will affect Epcot.\n“We want our visitors to be safe and to be informed of the seriousness of the disease,” Ms. Johnson said. “We want them to be able to find what they need to know about our hospital, our emergency services, their general knowledge and stress management.”\n——\nFollow Joan Lowy on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/APronyllowy\n']"

31,Everything you need to know about tonight's iHeart 'Living Room Concert for America',"['Tonight, the words of the night may feel more like a climax than an actual concert. This year, it’s Live Nation’s Homefront.\nHomefront, the name of a company that’s built and produces some of the most popular concerts in America, will announce a 25-year-old university building for America. It’s a brand new facility in Pensacola, Florida. It’s not the same as the Homefront itself, but it’s bigger, it’s bigger, and more powerful.\nAccording to a report by Live Nation, the institution is currently “expanding its design vision for its home away from home, with a strong focus on the ‘centre of play’ — telling fans how their favorite musical instrument will be produced in the center.”\nThis venue is a “live and urban experience” for fans to explore on a Friday night, according to the report. Now in place of stadium seats, it will be an outdoor, amphitheater, with a tent. The existing studios, Lighthouse Studios, will be consolidated under the roof, though the existing One Diamond Studios will still be set up to handle installations.\nThe facility, located in Florida’s Pensacola, will officially become home to Living Room Concerts for America on Sunday. Details on what Live Nation plans to put in the space have not been announced.\nPer the Gossip sister site, we’ve got the word that Live Nation is planning to move out of the venue and put up the live events to move into a smaller space at the Live Concerts for America headquarters. This will become the largest facility that resides in South Florida and will house approximately 750 live events.\nThe company also plans to bring some more live events to hosting events at the Point Bar & Lounge to between 175 and 230 thousand people. That, combined with NBC’s exposure to live events, and the fact that no one will live in the room and be afraid to party on the upper decks of the stadium, means Live Nation will have more than just more festival space.\nThe college tour will also include nationally-acclaimed musical artist shows like Afrojack, LeRoy Jones, and Johnny Snow.\nLive Nation did not specify what the events will be focused on, but said that it is “part of a larger cultural conversation to advance the lives of residents in our city.” Per the company, it plans to “focus more on the future of our city.”\nCatching up with Live Nation for America shows are certain to be fun. Live Nation is one of just a few ticket-buyers the company has on its Facebook page, giving fans the chance to get a look inside a venue that all fans are free to experience at once. For this concert, the music playing will be in a stage that will be voted on by the public, allowing them to see live music from all kinds of shows.\nMusic lovers will be able to “own everything,” something Live Nation emphasizes is that “Live Nation is committed to offering unparalleled affordable music experiences.” While technically true, it’s not a concession to all, especially if you’re a fan of live music, or members of the band sold out, I for one believe that there is something to be gained from it.\nAm I the only person in the country who won’t love this one, although it will certainly be a memorable experience? I would not feel guilty for wanting to follow the live music at one of America’s premier events. What I do want to be thankful for, however, is the live events on Sunday. People are going to have to take it as seriously as they can to be able to be in that room with all those huge and big faces paying attention. It’s going to be an enjoyable evening.\nTake a look at the live footage, the announcement of the Live Nation facilities in Florida, and the rest of this list.\n']"

(Khloe and Lamar Odom’s adopted child died two years ago and they both share a daughter, North.) Kardashian reportedly slapped Khloe while she was being treated for hyperextended knee, and West and Kourtney came back into the house after the surgery, kicking Khloe in the face.\nKhloé and Scott Disick returned home as a family last week, but this isn’t the first time that the celebrities have had their accounts hacked by hackers. In February 2017, Jenner and Disick, who have three children together, also got into a physical altercation.

They are, one, to restore consumers’ trust in the brand. Two, to own off-road vehicle construction and upgrade their dealer network while protecting the goods they bring home. And three, to leverage innovation as a way to steer the company forward.\nSo, from the moment we heard about the bad news of the company’s demise, that last thought resonated with us. According to the president of General Motors:\nWe believe that after enabling our customers to confidently set home on a superior road, we now stand on stronger footing with the rest of the world. Through this partnership with iconic corporations like Ford, BMW, and Honda, we are acting to stay ahead of the curve – to give our customers what they want and we are committed to manufacturing and building great vehicles on track to meet their needs.\nThe CEO certainly seems confident about the future of the company. But are Ford, Honda, and BMW ready to keep their momentum rolling in response to last week’s announcement?

Now we know why: Even apparently well-designed components - an interesting addition to the new design made from a Japanese technology that\'s possible to make a car from a simple double-loaded vacuum cleaner - could take a year or more to develop.\nThe reason is simple: the Foxtrot ""moonshot"" creates one of the fastest robots on the planet, at a rate of around seven days per hour, twice as fast as gravity. Because you can reach a two-hour driving speed at speeds up to 320km/h in a few days, the hole that Cocoon transforms into a shark effect will be unlike anything we\'ve seen before, offering world-class power output for working in extreme conditions.\nA simple filament laser tool that can pull the vacuum apart to make a sensor that looks like a pie-shaped robot\nIt hasn\'t been quite as well described, but thanks to its huge 5m diameter silicon panel, it only takes one or two days to build from its 100kg silicon module.

And with TurboDyne\'s efficient laser cutters, we couldn\'t wait to begin work on them.

And on the inside, its underpowered blade gives it slightly less air escaping from the machine, making the machine nearly 12 times smaller than normal armour.\nAnd while it certainly looks more interesting in concept form, the more pressing issue remains how NASA fits it into the research landscape. A core metal board maker has long attracted the attention of MIT, but the company has now received an order. And a website has been created to sell it as a desktop computer. (Appealing in theory, and both in practice)\nThe biggest concern, explained Professor Teresa Spalt, who oversees research at Portsmouth University, is developing a robotic body to travel anywhere in the world in order to reach Mars.

Jenny and her husband moved here a couple of years ago. She came from a rough Italian neighborhood of very poor families. It was just like my own life in 1994, just like the ones I grew up with.\nFor a while I thought that my grandparents were my “husband” and I just kinda like them. Since Jenny and I share no children, we decided we’d both do a little something. We recently had a difficult little wedding. We stayed at a church in Hamburg. I couldn’t even make it. That’s when I called the friend I knew who I was now in Erie County out of the blue. I thought it was Jenny. I thought it was David. I thought it was one of those stories you just don’t make in America. I wrote “Jannieny Has a Hooker, My Young Child Unhappy,” and when I heard her story, I knew I had to write it because she needed help. After I got a job as a reporter for a food truck in Buffalo, I wanted to show Jenny the ways in which I did. My friend (who’s on LinkedIn) immediately called me and begged me to do her story.\nThe joke has already started. This woman is 24 years old. She doesn’t just own a bar. She has a few kids and her best friend walks in and has nothing to do. She has suddenly realized that she doesn’t speak English as her father spoke English as her mother. She has looked into magic and found if her grandmother would let her open a jar of cardamom and talk to her about it, she’d be on the right track. The trick is that without it, Jenny has no right to learn to speak English. But she has this magical feeling of knowing that she, her grandfather, her teacher, her counselor and God are in the same conversation. She said she would check it out at the end of a school day. I knew for sure she’d love to. She said she couldn’t afford to do that.\nThe key is we get to know Jenny in just the first week of school, so you don’t have to write her off as a nice lady. My family has been welcoming Jenny at home. We’ve spent a lot of time together. Jenny hasn’t mind me telling her stories anymore. She’s one of the most incredible people I’ve ever met in my life.\nIf you like what I’ve been writing about, there’s one book coming out this week. That’s The Jesuits of Buffalo. Everyone’s friends, family, friends are here. There’s a list of almost 600 saints and we’ve had six coffee houses lined up right now. I’ve come to Buffalo every summer for the past five years to write about the Jesuits. If you’re a fan of faith and prayer, now is a perfect time to meet them for a cup of java.

The Air Force made the decision after listening to concerns among Afghans about the impact Afghanistan's shadow forces were having on security.\nOf those days, in 2014-15, the Air Force, fighting Taliban insurgents, continued to force a safe haven for the US troops around the world. It also found itself back in the kind of conflict that has dogged the western European region since the end of the Cold War.\nIn that “mighty war” a community has to rely on what is available, in our time. — US Air Force\nAs an army, a career is not an experience the military can afford. The Air Force is investing in intelligence capability that has been largely unassailable for decades.\nThe Air Force — where they were a total unknown when President Barack Obama launched the program — isn’t currently spending money on intelligence gathering. The budget for the department is $10.6 billion this year, but with the constant flow of money, they need about $9.6 billion, according to the Pentagon.\nThe Air Force has just the keys to the Green Zone, a security arrangement for 1,000 troops that has sheltered and permitted commanders to monitor and guide Afghan civilians as they made their way from the western region to Zabul province.\nMuch of the operation is just inside the Green Zone, but a concerted effort has been begun to shift the focus to the Green Zone through strategic partnerships and partnerships at the regional level, the Pentagon said.\nCockpit chatter at the Green Zone has come from human and academic experts, said Prince Sarwar, an MIT professor who went there to develop a psychological assessment on the force. He’s done extensive research on the complex environment it presents, and he has learned some things that say things like, “You make … policy and evidence; these things don’t make sense.”\nHis broader lesson is that if you put more soldiers in the Green Zone, you can take the places, like the Afghan National Army (ANA), where much of the effort has gone by the thousands, Sarwar said.\nThey’re entering from other bases. “The people that you’re going to put in there are all civilians. They’re civilians,” he said. “In a thoughtful way, you might as well go home. You’re living on your own with your peers and your families.”\nCanada’s soldiers can receive Canadian citizenship.

39,Why America has the world's most confirmed Covid-19 cases,"['The National Institutes of Health said on Wednesday that 27 of the 41 suspected Ebola cases it launched this year to treat infected people were captured or tracked.\nThe data uncovered new findings on the disease in Senegal, Liberia, Nigeria, Indonesia, Cameroon, Kenya, Senegal, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. These latest findings follow in the footsteps of Ebola cases recorded last year and help officials fight back more than seven years of Ebola outbreaks in west Africa.\n""This key series of hospital cases is being mobilized by NIH staff and collaborators to ensure the long-term health and safety of patients and their families,"" said Dr. David Francis, the NIH\'s director of infectious diseases.\nIn 2014, Ebola cases accounted for 40 percent of Ebola cases, a huge percentage.\nThe drug tamoxifen, which treats and reverses symptoms of the disease, is approved for the treatment of treating cases but had a lot of people who developed very severe symptoms from the spray, which Francis said was not a significant step up from current treatment options.\n""I would have liked to see all patients that have Ebola treated sooner, but ... we don\'t control everything but we try to do what we can to protect the patients and their families,"" he said.\nThe National Institutes of Health says there are now 1,764 suspected cases of Ebola in Africa and five deaths from it.\nA quick hospital visit\nStoring so much dead tissue can help care for patients and care for their families, but Ebola tends to kill even those who have lived a longer time. Doctors deliver the tissue, incubating it until the disease has exhausted its capacity to kill. The aim is to help treat it.\nStill, Francis said Monday it appeared there was nothing stopping the CDC from listing evidence of Ebola-like symptoms in Ebola-related cases in 2016.\n""Now with the ongoing Ebola epidemic, it appears to me that this could be a starting point, an alternative,"" he said.\nFrancis identified the first 13 confirmed Ebola cases recorded in September. They include an American, an African, and a Nigerian. One case of Ebola was transmitted by a woman in Niger, and there was no evidence that the results from this infection were connected. There were a few mild cases.\nThousands of gallons of contaminated blood were collected from three people who had visited the American medical center where Francis was working as a university professor in Liberia when Ebola was identified and an Argentine man infected in Sierra Leone, federal prosecutors said.\nLast month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared that Ebola is a threat to public health. The agency has yet to put out a detailed report on the disease.\nFrancis said the Ebola story continues to define a worsening trend for the health of some Kenyans. While Ebola can spread through contact with medical aid workers or by under-vaccinated people who\'ve not been vaccinated, some particularly vulnerable individuals in developing countries — an estimated 250,000 of the 1.3 million people living in Africa\'s most vulnerable states — remain at high risk of Ebola.\n""We know that the vast majority of people who are at highest risk of Ebola have been infected,"" Francis said. ""We know that more than 70 percent of those who have been infected have returned to their families, which is high.""\n']"
40,Abortion is a human right. A pandemic doesn't change that,"[""The United States nation is very lucky for at least 12 years that Abraham Lincoln was not assassinated. Twenty-three presidents and three scores of community leaders have passed through the veins of abortion. In more than two-and-a-half years the figure fell from over 800,000 votes to around half a million, according to the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Given this, it is easy to dismiss the recent passage of the Heller case as an aberration.\nBut history is telling us that humanity has evolved as a species. These allies of slavery, oppression and servitude are providing what ought to be the usual minimum of protectiveness to free people. Not incidentally, the international order in which we live produces us major concern and intimidation of individuals and their families. We have entered a culture of a society of armed armed force that threatens imperatives and threatens protection to the innocent.\nViolence, coercion and denial of basic rights and freedoms invariably arise through violent acts of political violence. In the United States today, one should not blame the armed forces or the courts for failing to comply with First Amendment protection of free speech and fair and equal opportunity for everyone. The majority of citizens will not be forced to respect lawful and non-violent alternatives to armed conflict. What should never happen is that armed forces and the courts act as a threat to people’s rights in order to suppress criticism and dissidence, undermining freedom of expression, due process and rule of law.\nConsequently, the role of armed forces should be limited to upholding the law. But do we have to abolish a fifth of the human race to give rise to a new stage of life? Yes, we do. We must rise above the self-serving beliefs of personal change agents. We must rise above fear and bigotry in order to respect human rights, national security and civil liberties.\nThanks to Margaret Thatcher and Margaret herself, we have so much to fear but are we not prepared to use it effectively. We need to change those beliefs to the means of persuasion and persuasion through armed force or surveillance or other forms of physical coercion, coercion or insensitivities.\nThe problem is that armed forces, after all, are children of the Constitution. It is supposed to protect them as human beings from harm or disaster. But they are not, not because there are no limits on their duties and responsibilities, but because nothing can risk their safety or resocialization to do so. They are human beings, risking their own lives and the interests of the country they govern. The fact that they protect this right threatens to violate their rights to be free and free to conduct their lawful activities. What kind of life they like?\nA civil rights lawyer probably can offer some insight into why armed forces are no worse than its adult form of civil rights. The general answer is that armed forces need the faithful participation of non-military cadres. They should develop a certain familiarity with the issue. They should not be afraid to see the abuse of rights; they need the guardianship of their relatives, especially young people, who have said many times in courtrooms that the armed forces and their personal protection are a threat to their safety and safety to their own, through threats and intimidation and harassment.\nIf it is possible to defend human rights and freedoms without alienating the American people, we must tackle these challenges head on in 2015. We must bring the forces to account and elevate them to the category of professionals who will fight the maximum possible in the face of violent threats and in avoiding abusing those rights. We must take equal care and attention to them. We must resist their hypermodern interpretations of the rights and protections that go with their normal duties. We must avoid the false invasions and marginalization of the legitimate rights and protections of others.\nIt is important to understand that it is not the founding principle of the United States that protects civil liberties. Certainly we at the ACLU, in lobbying and other organizations, support the civil rights tradition of the Founding Fathers. Indeed, you will not find much evidence that our founding fathers ever meant to protect those rights. Indeed, while our role is to defend civil liberties and to prevent the abuse of rights, they also struggled with those rights, and then we walked away, though the civil rights lawyer and civil rights advocates still stand and help them defend our rights.\nAbraham Lincoln's commitment to civil liberties in the first place was enormous. Why should we owe it to Abraham Lincoln and all others to champion those social and physical rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and that of the people who hold them? It is well past time we acknowledge these rights and seize them on the day.\n""]"
41,"The Covid-19 culprit is us, not pangolins","['While Peru\'s education is far from perfection, the severe problem of pangolins remains one of many serious issues facing the country\'s agriculture, forestry and landscape sectors.\nThe dominant presence of pangolins has been seen in environments across Peru, such as extreme forest and mountain terrain, and deep in the Choco nation. This has since led to violent clashes between Peru\'s indigenous peoples, indigenous communities and the various organized small-scale illegal farmers that have clashed with the communities themselves. More recently, for example, the skirmishes of war, threatened by sub-human Tuberculosis, have also been reported across Peru.\nThese are the main problems facing Peru as a whole. Studies place countries such as Chile and France among the major originators of pangolins, leading to a shortage of skills in them.\nUnequivocal information about the dangers in Peru pervades the news and social media. Therefore, just as accusations of pangolins arising from conflict are difficult to deny, pangolins themselves are unknown.\nFortunately, scientists and scientists of all stripes like to project expertly on climate change. Yet since the late 1960s, scientists and researchers have demonstrated a strong correlation between man-made climate change and natural variability and increased threat of climate change. But, with attention switched on, of course, this connection turns out to be wrong.\nThis discovery raises the question: how do you prove that there\'s a relationship between climate change and pangolins and the rise of the planet\'s anthropogenic climate change?\nIn order to quantify the impact of climate change on humans, this is what scientists have called a ""coherent process"" whereby an event triggers a causal link between climate change and climate change.\nBecause temperatures are expected to rise, an event triggers a causal link between climate change and humans, taking account of anything from human climate change in the range of the solar season to biodiversity loss from botany to greater anxiety about climate change and anomalous climate variability.\nThen, because human global warming is an actual and likely natural phenomenon, we may use this framework to define human climate change (or other known greenhouse-gas trends such as burning fossil fuels and man-made emissions), as well as those of climate change as a ""price"", ""meta-climate"" event and the resulting effects on humans, agricultural societies and all other ecosystems around the world.\nIn determining the relation between temperature and man-made climate change, our thinking over time has yielded the following two factors: the fossil-fuel era, and rapidly change in soil levels. The two contrasting factors are natural variability and man-made global warming.\nHowever, we need to incorporate multiple sources of fluctuations: natural variability, human loss and increased human needs in order to be able to accurately predict climate change. One such factor is that the increasing warming of the Earth\'s atmosphere is accompanied by increased human activity, particularly in coastal areas, which is expected to cause climate variability.\nIn order to accurately assign nature\'s influence on climate and its impact on humans, scientists can assess organic carbon dioxide and other natural-chemical substances across more than 1.5 billion individual Earths. We do not currently know exactly what these pollutants are, but anthropogenic climate change will change this chemical layer as heat waves and floods, already known to be climate dependent and long-term effects, increase over time.\nIf predictions of climate change are accurate, then the problems associated with man-made climate change require statistical methods, not analytical ones. The best way to do this is by comparing wind and solar data on a global scale, using different lenses from which to measure emissions.\nA recent study by Ajinow has been published in the Journal of Meteorology and Geophysics, and has analysed the prevalence of carbon dioxide emission from Earth\'s aerosols.\nAlso, we need to know exactly the duration of our average carbon dioxide increase from 4 to 10 times over the past 100 years.\nOur basic approach is rather different from that employed by the natural selection theorists of the oceans.\nOur pattern of emissions continues to be shaped by changes in ocean temperatures around the world, from more intense and extreme tropical storms, to warmer waters and hot temperatures with the warmest waters in the Pacific Ocean. These varied impacts on our climate, in the form of fluctuating solar energy changes and increased human presence, point to a relationship that continues to shape our planet.\nThis article was first published in The Conversation on N°82\n']"
42,How history can bring us hope right now,"[""Indoors of a dark, bleak landscape, a masked man walks up to an old rostrum — a tall, rounded man — and sings by choir. It's that kind of quiet history.\nA few hours later, real people like Mark Norgaard and Anthony Caro — a married couple with an open heart and a beautiful daughter, whose marriage is the source of years of thick, still scarred nightmares — and their daughter, who is seven, walk to the corner of this desolate old cemetery, through a quiet, ominous feel. The teens observe past horrors, the huge trees, the snow that covers the gaps between its plod the pale, dark-penetrating sun and the orange, mud-caked soil. Caro, a lifetime resident of this park, reads the newspaper a couple hours before he's scheduled to meet the cretins and settlers at our reservation to hear the stories of a lifetime, yet by listening, we know what we need to feel: hope for another chance to meet a stranger and meet a bigger stranger.\nThe story then begins in a small town in north Tennessee, where Mark and his wife, Jane, have invested several hundred acres into preserving the place, containing the Sioux and Native American historicals. The drive begins in a quiet suburban town, where Mark hears the original, unmarked American frontier from his grandparents and hearing from so many people about the other side. 'And that was what we called a Native American aborigine, then disappeared. 'Only in the town of Grand Vales and kept by the rust-colored jerry cans sitting on the ground,' he writes.\nA couple of weeks later, in a good old-fashioned fairground market on Migratory Bird Day, his wife and their daughter drive out to see another boy and his brother grieve. This is the week he plans to meet one of the nameless dead. And so instead of hanging on to a small town: his big brother and his friend journeyed from one place to another on foot. The dunes are dotted with the dirt and the girders are often dark, wet, and only smooth as a rain shower.\nReligion and medicine are the combined essentials that fill the Soul Soul. At 17, when Mark was 14, a young boy from nearby Worthington, Minn., joined the church right out of school. He had small, rough-hewn, domestic and farm life that included working on hog and iron. The experience gave Mark a real sense of optimism and a sense of being accepted. After college, he began writing books about American history and about his ancestors. He cut a woman out of the book and stayed at her in her pregnant daughter's home.\nHe's written about how he and his wife made a life out of the time and created happiness by reading, becoming sobered by what happened to them, learning to live with terrible and heavy trauma and going from home to church (Christian spirituals are the best way to look at it) to the occasional assignment to a grave site where I wonder if these lucky American blacks might see the graphic, close-ups of the well-prolific Mississippi Man. We've lost heroes like this and are unable to get back to those back in spirit. Our hopes and fears are separate from the power and substance of God.\nMark and Jane hope that our time doesn't end here at Little River, Idaho, where our young people will be and will eventually feel more at ease and feel secure about one another, finding the time to tour a handful of abandoned houses and visit the Cherokee Nation's many histories, now as they are a part of our lives. Our heroes are slowly replaying them, in ways they don't know how. They are being erased, but we're fighting back.\n""]"

51,The photographer who captured Hollywood's last wild decade,"['The American movies of the 1950s and 1960s are one of the most iconic in cinematic history, but one photographer does everything he can to preserve it.\nWaterford, Massachusetts-based artist Bill Kirkman\'s devotion to keeping the films he shot in as varied a visual style was demonstrated over the years when he was handed the photos as they were pulled from one of the last commercial shoots of the era. Kirkman had kept up the magnificently spontaneous photographic style of his childhood, buying water buckets, rummage through old film libraries, and collecting all the old footage in a granary during his visits to the studio.\n""I used to get lost in the papers in the off season when I\'d get into the studio and I\'d try to figure out why they were getting shot so long,"" Kirkman said in an interview from his Vine Street studio. ""But even in the 60s, I couldn\'t figure out why it took so long to get some of the artifacts.""\nKirkman died on March 11, and his work in the early \'60s and the early \'70s has also found a new home in Scott Sperling\'s annual exhibit ""Instinct: Photography 101."" For over a decade, the artist, whose sole work is still photography, worked as a performer in South Florida\'s Livewire Theater. He gathered the footage from the documentary to create the iconic How to Solve the Curtain, which was part of an exhibition featuring the work of 24 photographers that were featured at the Nikon D6100 on display in a D6100 booth in 2010. As the exhibition moves through its second week, galleries will continue to stock Kirkman\'s photographs alongside such regional favorites, including ""Vessel of the Night"" in Oregon and ""Art Thou.""\n""I wasn\'t always worried about the job, but when I started looking into other artists I had to take notes,"" Kirkman said. ""At my leisure, I was recording the footage I\'d taken and then adding new information, turning it into something I could use to more effectively describe the style I was working in. As it evolved, and with my social skills, I was developing into a sartorial photographer, it became something I practiced while away my school hours.""\nKirkman\'s life is unlike any it has ever known, but it\'s not just his pictures and use of film that made him a prolific ""student photographer,"" he said. His style is nearly a 22-year old, one that continues to show in a variety of galleries throughout the country. The exhibit is not named as such, but Kirkman and the Miller Gallery are available for purchase in exchange for his photos. Kirkman died on February 28, and the exhibit, which can be found in his Vine Street studio, will continue its second week on April 8.\nThe idea for the exhibit, designed by Tara Sullivan, prompted Kirkman to become a cinematographer. ""I wasn\'t looking at directing now when I was a child, but I knew how to do that as a film director,"" he said. ""There were a lot of questions, and he encouraged me to start thinking about the thing I would like to do. It felt like a time when people knew me better, and I had to engage myself with the idea of how I would use film footage.""\nThe Arthur Miller exhibition runs through June 4.\n']"

Only 4 seasons before, using fans who have been totally inspired.""\nPaltrow is also an individual herself and is taking images of her creations to sell as part of a show that is inspired by the art of women who redefined pop culture for the Internet. Paltrow, the daughter of late director Martin Scorsese, has sold more than 8 million limited-edition catwalk dresses.\nHinting that a decision on her future was on the minds of the media, Paltrow said that she wanted to “study the works of contemporary artists” when approaching “this modestly budgeted decision.”\nThe ""Lilithlight"" crowd, she said, can appreciate her personal style through her videos and stylized moves as well as her role as an executive producer.\nWhile she brought her own design philosophy to bear on the ""Lilithlight"" tours, Paltrow understands the role of feminism and responsibility — not just from fashion’s perspective but also from fashion’s — in exposing female creativity and affecting fashion.\nAsked whether she thought she was taking part in a representative of ""the rule of no, or just the rules, so to speak,"" she replied, “Always a judge and a watch-watch-watch who follows the rules and courts of dress are really… infinite.”\nPaltrow does admit that she’s “little bit hard” on the role of feminism.\nShe says that feminism is a “tough, powerful, country-western song (and) that does things, and there’s a lot of great talent out there.

54,How innovative design is reshaping the sex tech industry,"['The suggestion for a sex-based fashion line to adhere to the name “Ultra Gentle” has raised a few eyebrows in fashion circles, much as it would have generated a lot of controversy if the brand had branded itself as the latter. But two of the designer’s daughters gave their own advice to the brand’s own direction, speaking out against the sexual-based clothing and accessories, and forming a panel of a dozen young people from the clothing industry to talk about the issue.\nSwedish duo Eliajelimo and Veronica al-Jaabari, co-founders of Trans Collective, have become good friends since they took the reins of their founded self-taught production company in 2007. Jaabari works as an executive design team at Panasonic’s Jung Soo Je — the manufacture of condoms, lubricants, heat-resistance devices, et al. — and al-Jaabari is the head of the company’s photography division. At Trans Collective, Eliajelimo and Veronica are co-founders and chief creative officer of Adult Self, which specializes in sex-related clothing. “Our ethos is we try to allow a fresh approach to fashion,” said al-Jaabari, who inspired the tagline on Adult Self. “Our desire is to give our products a more original and sexually expressive image.”\nThe answer to sex industry complacency, though, may well lie in two areas: menswear and edgier accessories. Alternating fashion and brand looks can help to bridge that generational divide, especially with the increasing prevalence of edgier silhouettes. In these two categories, sex-focused apparel is more accepted, but they are not just about one or two items. “Sex apparel is the tail end of the tail end of your entire casualwear,” said said al-Jaabari. “We wanted to tell sex ed a fashion message that we wanted to convey with power and sophistication.”\nBaby clothes —as defined in Fetish Yoga — are another important exception, one that is popular with young women. According to Fetish Yoga’s researcher, Ida Sarmiento-Brao-O-I and the Fetish Yoga West Desk — the newest name within the brand — Delicate, available at Nordstrom, Forever 21, & H&M, sex-based jewelry is also something older women are embracing, too.\n“Going from an educational background to a career development pathway is a big turnaround for both parents and young women,” said Iris Shah, president of Delicate, calling her company’s new first fragrance, “fresh grass.” While feminine details are most prominent at younger women, Shah said there are also pop-up sistas who often catch sight of such feminine edges, which the company didn’t do when the topic of sex initially surfaced in news headlines. “I want consumers to explore these [feminine] edges; whether it’s to define themselves or just see who’s there,” she said. “Feminine quality is part of what makes modern women so fun.”\n']"
55,"From 'Pushing Daisies' to 'Five Feet Apart,' screen romances for the social-distancing age","['“Pushing Daisies” is based on the 1997 book of the same name, written by E.P. Moroney in the circumstances.\n“Pushing Daisies” opened on Friday and nabbed 41% in its sophomore weekend.\n“Pushing Daisies” (based on Mark Davis’ initial book), tells the story of a Los Angeles book publisher and his adopted son (Orlando Bloom), who suffers the most in his life from a debilitating allergic reaction that could cause such severe symptoms as pollen, jaundice, a broken heart, severe constipation and numerous incurable cancers.\nAgreed to the Pulitzer Prize for drama this week by the National Book Critics Circle for a play of the same name, the two-hander, written by Moroney, centers on one man’s search for true love by his best friend (Stellan Skarsgård), who’s in a relationship with the sister of an ill-fated sister-in-law (Anne-Marie Duff).\n“I’m doing a two-hander with Daniel in Chicago,” Moroney tells The Hollywood Reporter. “She’s a very different person and she’s quite personable, sweet and likable. I think that love is about faithfulness and kindness, which is what the character is worried about right now.”\nIt is much like the story that Moroney told when he bought the book, in that he sat as novelist and during a transition into screenwriting, he started looking at all the different things that make up a character’s life story.\n“There’s this old school philosophy of storytelling that tells us that through the stories we’re told, the ‘powers’ of a story are us and the stories we tell. I’m proud of Daniel as an actor and as a writer for the first time,” he says. “I still make a lot of mistakes and how much of a change in the story that I’ve had to alter is something to be taken aback by, but I have faith in him.”\nMoroney says that he wanted to do the play after writing a feature length movie about a troubled young woman (Naomi Watts), so he was surprised by how much the book inspires empathy.\nThe play features a cast of about 50 plus well-known actors and actresses, including Queen Latifah, Regina Hall, Margot Robbie, Ashton Sanders, Lizzie Dee (Kate Walsh), who has a crush on Beckham, and stars Downton Abbey’s Maggie Smith, who starred as Tracy Swartz in the British sitcom “Speechless” and plays Christina Christina Adair in “The Twilight Zone.”\nMoroney plans to pick up “The Twilight Zone” and movies in the future, but the possibility of the British TV adaptation of “The Twilight Zone” in Hollywood still seems remote.\n“It’s a great idea,” he says. “Like ‘Pushing Daisies’ did, it was wildly successful, but a lot of us have struggles in the industry, which is why I know the show for young people has an interesting format. It’s basically like ‘Robbie Goes to Work,’ a sketch comedy show with an American-British twist, and you get eight kids from the U.K. trying to bounce between different types of experience, which is a joy. You’ve got the chance to do a lot of crime and lots of romance and a lot of art. It’s fantastic.”\nMoroney is also taking a peek into the life of his second wife, Princess Diana, which are featured in “The Twilight Zone,” which will premiere at the home of Diane Keaton and Sharon Stone at Manhattan’s 2 Arts Museum on March 24.\nHe is already looking at television roles.\n“I got an offer to do ‘Vinyl’ in New York, and it could be a fairy tale about Diana,” he says. “Then ‘King Kong’ and then I would probably read biographies of other people, but I really love the television show.”\n']"

Mexico and the Philippines had reported the deaths, the department said, while the highly contagious Dengue virus confirmed on Thursday in Buenos Aires province was in Peru and the Philippines, but there had been no confirmed cases in North America.\nBut Donahue said the department was working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and their partners in tracking the cases and discovering that they had perished.\nHe said the department\'s technology on mobile phone devices and email accessed data as well as heart rate data. He said the department also conducted testing on three helicopters, carrying out an eye exam in Buenos Aires on Friday and an eye exam in Manila on Sunday. All are expected to be sent to central and southern Africa to transport them to the newest locations.\nDonahue said efforts were underway to identify a third patient and quarantine flights to Zimbabwe. Those arrangements are expected to be finalized by weekend.\nThe virus has been classified as a pandemic, including a winter mystery to have spread to the United States and Europe. Cases of the virus have been reported in 18 countries in Asia, including Asia, the U.S. and Canada, France, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, China, Russia, Indonesia, South Korea, and North and Central America.\nMost of the 132 cases reported in Europe as of Friday were in Wales, a decision said to be largely unconnected to the Bardo-Zambian case.\nIf confirmed, the outbreak could disrupt travel to countries like South Africa, where for the past two weeks travel to areas severely affected by the virus has been affected.\nDonahue said some staff from the United States, Israel, and other countries have been involved in the work to train an advisory group to better understand the virus.\nThe State Department also warned travelers Thursday to prepare to travel outdoors but said its travel advice did not change: ""Avoid strenuous outdoor activities while in contact with the virus.""\n____\nSherri Jeffrey may be reached at http://twitter.com/tjandersonAP\n']"

The tornado uprooted trees and left its trail of destruction along and around Woodstar Wilderness State Park, which houses a wildlife refuge.\n“The Tree Sisters of Arkansas are helping children and parents clean their homes while storms approach,” Halter said in a Twitter post on Sunday. “You’re too busy to take care of yourself.”\nThat was true for most Arkansans, since the storm stretched as far west as Oklahoma City, about 75 miles southeast of the city of Rock Island.

60,How long will Trump's poll surge last?,"['Of all the major surveys that have measured negative outcomes in U.S. presidential elections this year, the latest contains precisely one revealing headline: “Millennials: Kids with low income, don’t vote, say persistently high rates of civic engagement.”\nThanks in part to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s surprising strength, the Pew Research Center’s finding this month that fewer millennials are expected to vote in the November election comes as no surprise. In fact, if you ask the millennial respondents whether they are going to take a stick at a candidate, their answers are almost identical. Surveys of voters like these – and a sure sign that Trump’s surge is just beginning – are already setting records as the number of people who have expressed an interest in voting increases, while the generation tied to the present is only slightly behind its self-declared and Millennial counterparts.\nClearly, these, or other parts of the electorate, is “controlling,” the Pew survey found. Even excluding Trump, the share of millennials without voting reached a historic low of 63 percent. In this depressing state of affairs, it should be no surprise that Trump’s ascent as the 2016 Republican nominee is widening the numbers of Millennials that aren’t in actual voting-age brackets.\nIn the polling booths, some believe that Trump is actually living up to his nickname by doing better than his Dem challenger, Hillary Clinton. “Early on, she and me put on a best and worst dressed (Trump would say ‘are we going to put some fucking white superheroes in his tank?’ but I could do worse) and we really had a spirited campaign,” one source told Vox. But the results of this assessment, among others, are a turn-off: more young adults now feel anxious about voting than ever before, and young Democrats are increasingly turning off to Trump.\nThe Obama-era period—August-October 2016—is the latest period to reveal that millennial voters continue to be faced with midterm uncertainty in large numbers. Just one-third of respondents in a survey of mid-2016 asked whether or not they thought Congress would make a difference in the long-term future of the U.S. economy. Nine-in-ten Democrats have said that the Trump administration is simply making things worse. Even for moderate Republicans and independents, millennials are dissatisfied about the direction the GOP has taken.\nMoreover, American voters’ perceptions of Trump have barely budged in a decade, with the support of 56 percent of young adults and 52 percent of independents in 2016 compared to just 37 percent for their age group in 2015. That’s an astonishing difference: 76 percent of young adults and 68 percent of independents who identify as likely to vote in the Nov. 8 election identified as Republicans in 2016. Similarly, Trump has outperformed his Dem challenger, who received a 71 percent vote boost from young adults, compared to only 39 percent of independents and just 31 percent of Democrats.\nPerhaps Trump’s rise is greater than that of the popular vote, and perhaps it is only a matter of time before the trend reverses. But even as the surge of people desiring to turn out in large numbers, millennials remain little more than passive swing voters. They are pretty much the most loyal in a democratic society to the Donald Trump of today, since they just may not have the stamina to match his towering self-promotion and his blatantly racist campaign promises.\n']"

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)\nAmericans are taking their respective turn today as they vote for their presidential nominee. Hillary Clinton leads her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, with 47.6 percent, according to a preliminary 2018 U.S. News/YouGov poll.\nBut Trump hasn\'t secured even half the pledged delegates that he wants, let alone more than 1,200 votes in the general election. Just 48 percent of voters have cast their ballot for him.\nThen there\'s the total number of registered voters. In total, Clinton trails Trump by 14 percent. It\'s a close race but in a favorable variety -- with Trump the big winner in the Electoral College by 8 points with 15.8 percent.\nTrump wants more Republicans to vote for him, looking at 16 percent who are independents. Clinton, who has 1.7 percent, is much closer to that target. She\'s also got 3.1 percent of those who are white conservatives and 1.9 percent of those who are members of ""the upper caste."" That\'s the level of support for Donald Trump among the so-called ""white white,"" evangelical, lower-income and immigrant communities.\nTrump needs 25 percent of the pledged delegates, Clinton in that order. The amount of their votes should be in the millions.\nOther clear indications of Republican gender gaps include the fact that Trump remains the heavy favorite among African-Americans, Hispanics and whites. On the GOP side, Republican elites are rounding into the black bloc, posting solid gains among Latinos and whites, which could lead to a similar level of Republican support among African-Americans and Latinos.\nIn the Independents, Republican leaders are relatively young, 28 percent, followed by Democrats at 37 percent. That\'s a rise of 9 points from Trump\'s 18 points. Independents have long been redder and angrier and more conservative; that trend has marked Trump\'s performance among Independents over the past year.\nRegarding Americans who voted for Trump this month, CBS News/Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump with a good lead over Clinton.\nSeven out of 10 expected to vote for Clinton (53 percent) or Trump (34 percent), while a plurality of likely Independents have favored Clinton (56 percent). She seems to be benefitting from Trump\'s favorable-news sentiment.\nOf what people seem to be thinking, there\'s some difficulty here.

Cuomo criticizing the billionaire for his handling of voter fraud and Cuomo attempting to assuage concerns over voter suppression in New York.\nThat's the actual catch-phrase you have to go up against — “take your anger out.”\nOpinion polls have shown this. In February of this year, 33 percent of New Yorkers registered to vote. And these new findings make the matter worse:\nAccording to a Quinnipiac University poll released this week, 53 percent of New Yorkers say it's too soon to conclude the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, but in an interview on the NBC Late Show with David Letterman, Cuomo concluded that because Trump might be too honest to be important and because people like Hillary Clinton don't want to take part in it, he'll devote all of his energies to winning.\nAnd now Hillary's getting some hell.\nMonday night — the end of the long winter with no snow — Cuomo and Trump may have in recent days faced off in some sort of ferocious public battle, during which Trump and Clinton sparred off about their parts of the country, rails Trump, and Trump’s big criticism of the Mexican border. During one discussion, a bald-faced Trump ripped Clinton for a proposal she referred to as “showboating.” It worked. Trump then shot back over the insults and outraging Clinton, saying it would be hard for the incoming president to be real about the plight of the poor and undocumented.\nThis was almost an afterthought to anyone who hasn’t watched CNN's coverage of the race. We have a voting record that strongly suggests that if you want your candidates to look good, you need to be out front, and Trump’s endless testing of his civics knowledge — every TV debate had his own extraordinary opportunity — happened there.\nBut a recent Post poll placed much more importance on the issue: 47 percent of New Yorkers felt Clinton should quit the race. She would be booted off after 44 days; 54 percent would not tolerate her changing of the course. But I think only about that.\nIn short, the reasons Clinton’s tribe of voters took the fight this close were that Trump was too fearful of her and Cuomo’s message, saying Trump came here with a “yes” vote. They’re saying, “Man, we all know what you need to do.” And maybe we could see the contrast because the voters have a voter base that would never tolerate an opponent who can’t speak for herself.\nThere’s certainly a lot going on between the two candidates. It’s going to be testy. But this is also going to be a confusing game of chess between race, gender, class, and so on. (Shocker, my friend: “I don’t like it when the guy who gets the most votes isn’t the guy who gets the most votes.”)\nAt the end of the day, it’s like a gay Easter egg hunt. Meanwhile, between California Democrats who expect to break down the wall of Democratic control of Congress and the Trump-Cuomo vehemence — who got a nice message delivered on stage by the governor of Vermont — there’s a marathon election night at the end.\nThe point is that the only questions Hillary’s got going on with us at this point are the Democratic nominee and the challenger.\nAnd it may be too much time. The only question to ask is whether it's too early to judge her. And the outcome is a significant influence on the relationship.\n""]"

She soon found that she was much more excited about the company's future than the past few years of financial stagnation.\n“The acquisition of Arrow Electronics, which will be renamed Arrow Free Corporation and create more than 900 positions, is my greatest achievement,” said Peter Auverma, an investor who helps his wife sell their primary residence in Osaka.\nAt its peak the company had revenues of 1,729 billion yen ($3.1 billion) and a net loss of 726 billion yen for the nine months ended March.\n“I was more excited about the turnaround than I was about the stock market conditions,” said Anita El, the former CEO of a now-defunct GM Motors Corp car wholesaler, when El, her son-in-law Norio Mikoshita and others helped craft the merger of the two companies.\nThe company’s stock was trading at more than 52 times next year’s projected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of 543 billion yen, or $3.11 billion at current exchange.\nFor months, the company’s shares rallied, hitting a one-year high and changing hands within a few minutes of the announcement, closing at 21.00 yen, about 0.45 percent higher than the previous day’s close.\nBased on the latest quarterly earnings, Arrow’s underlying yield was 3.4 percent at the end of last year, behind the 6.9 percent and 6.1 percent analysts expected.\nThat makes the company, which charges a higher monthly interest, a “Small Business of the Year” by the Japanese Federation of Builders, a foundation of influential Japanese manufacturers that funds its research and development.\nThe household name, which analysts consider one of the country’s strongest, was at the heart of Arrow’s turnaround.\nIITB\nBetween the launch of an online business and the rollout of its mobile app, Arrow had grown revenue from about 2 billion yen in 2011, to more than 6.5 billion yen in 2016.\nIt aims to turn around the business this year and has hired 10 people, including a new head of forecasting who led the company's business planning, said an executive who asked not to be named.\nCEO Tom Yoshimura, who has carved out his reputation by ensuring that the company remains profitable for its loyal customers and pushing the company up the speedway of the smartwatch industry, said in December that “some weaknesses” in the business were being rectified.\n“We could have invested more as an add-on to an existing product,” he said in an interview. “But if you were designing new products, you’d have to do it differently.”\nWith the stock trading above its 50-day moving average around 61 yen, little is known about the insider trading case against Yoshimura.\nStill, this director tried his best to turn the company around.\nIitamatsu D, who opened the handset business in 1996 and later joined Roche Holding AG as a researcher, began researching products, researching the financial health of the company, and the design and distribution of handhelds and TVs.\nOn selling hardware and software services, he charged for the services of sales staff and delivered programs to owners. He eventually sold two sports companies, now part of a consortium in late 2017.\nArrow is now selling products and services to European telecom providers, the marketing network for its mobile services and its financial mobile technology.

The gadget has proven this difficult because of its high price, a shortage of big screen products and its persistent popularity as a first feature category.\n""From what I\'ve seen, it\'s one of the biggest investments we\'ve made in cinemas and cinema technologies in history,"" Ferriss told Beet.co.uk\nBeyond the cinema: ""The use of super-small screens and sharing effects, they\'ve been used for decades. But only now is it being marketed and used as a mainstream cinema product,"" he said.\nWhen it comes to the movies and TV, there\'s still a long way to go to make that movie a mainstream feature. If you\'re buying a projector, what do you want to see? Cinema, that\'s the majority of cinema. The average annual cost for a projector is around $3,000, down from $4,000 a decade ago. (Even though you can buy a projector at any cinema chain for nearly $10,000, which is a drop from $15,000 and $50,000 a decade ago.)\nSo far this year, cinema has added 2,627 films, 300 feature films and 10 TV series to its combined box office. Rounding out the industry\'s numbers is streaming and video game consoles, which account for 77% of all revenues. On the back of this, comes the Amazon Prime Video system, which brings in a bundle of $65 of every year since it\'s launched.\n""This year is the year of ubiquity,"" Ferriss said.

The five-season season is now live. FHKC anchor Elise Staneff tells us she is cooking up a plan of attack for their marketing campaign.\nLast month, co-owner Zander Craft created a special bun that made their signature spicy red sauce of red beans and rice. Customers had their own seat and purchased their own flat-serve plate. Craft, a former five-time “30 for 30,” says they were 100 percent sold out.\nThe restaurant has been officially licensed by CHCA, and Craft says their goal is to open the farmers market as a 24-hour event through the end of June.\n""We haven’t planned out an overnight event for 24/7,"" Craft says. ""When we came into this gig they told us there was a business to be had.""\nCraft has the complete recipe for the Wild Kale Salad and the fresh organic French Onion Cheese, cooked in soy-infused water and topped with crisp lettuce leaves. He also teaches a cooking class on golf course with his culinary skills and that point is being incorporated into the Grapefruit and Winfrey Meal Perfection.\n""I was shocked by all the action happening,"" Craft says. ""People leaving the restaurant had their way on the highways and they just got to keep the business afloat.""\nCraft\'s business is particularly important to young urban farmers—he recruits them all to the Market Court studio at CHCA and for a short time there he and his team cultivate the fresh, local ingredients that grow for the market. What Craft brings to this space is a fresh face with an eye to improving local business.\nWhile I found Craft intriguing, I also noticed that he is using the location as the spark to get new immigrants to part of the city—people who may not be familiar with Chicago.\n""I like to provide a market where people can not only see where the community is located but can actually participate in the neighborhood they live in, which is a lot of people from southern Illinois,” Craft says. ""People who come from Chicago now have a lot more opportunity.""\nCraft is working on a big plan to create an indoor farmers market for near-residential neighborhoods. FHKC appreciates the opportunity he can offer visitors to a farmers market from the start. They\'ll be building out space in their building, as well as employee capacity. He doesn\'t want his brother-in-law to walk down the street and buy the soup he uses every day. The short-term business plan for Hreswell Farms is to develop 50 small-scale farmer’s markets in the CSA.\n""I don’t have any particular plans but I do have a pretty good understanding of where these markets are going to go, and I believe we’ll make it happen,"" Craft says. ""We want to be the go-to place for Chicago’s food businesses. That means we’ll be able to meet new customers. It’s awesome to get to a place like this, but we don’t have an overwhelming total. We’re trying to make it a really exciting, live-off-the-mike experience for everyone.

He later joined the national government and worked in the office for many years.\nHe has a current job with a U.S. service provider. Coramcos is most proud of his love of the game of soccer and the tough decisions he made to support her over the past five years.\n“She was my best friend and I don’t think I’ll ever ever forget her. When she told me, I was a little embarrassed. I would sit in a corner talking to her and it’s hard on me to even think of her,” he said.\nThe Catholic Diocese of Roxbury is working to establish a community legal centre in honour of his friend. Staff members have been brought in from Mexico, Argentina, and Germany.\nThe grief is being felt all over the province of Queretaro, which borders La Mejia, which has a population of 1,831.\n“I was shocked by the first words Jose told me that I couldn’t do,” said Genevieve Ramirez.\nCoramcos was identified after a witness was allegedly seen inside the family’s winery. He was also known by his initials J.\nCoramcos is from the conservative region of Roxbury, where law enforcement agencies have been targeting foreign exchange students who travel abroad to purchase illegal gold and silver using bogus documents.\nHe was the son of a teacher and a social worker. He was out of France and was recently taken into custody by police after having his passport revoked in an international police operation in Mexico.\nRamirez said in general, the crime of smuggling is the most common way people smuggle gold and silver into the country, and Coramcos joined the local business community in 2018.\n“He’s a successful business man and the thought he would return home, while he was in jail and has the only way to escape justice would be so that he would have to leave,” she said.\nRamirez said Coramcos called her hours after he died and told her, “I’m OK. You’re OK. I appreciate you. Please hurry.”\nThe town cannot open a formal memorial to him.\n“I love the people of Roxbury and I wouldn’t wish that any other way. I’m not going to regret leaving and thinking of him,” she said.\n']"

But the report said the death toll was coming from influenza and when the fourth reported case was found on Sunday, many speculate it was the coronavirus.\nUSAID has seen less serious impacts as teams and authorities involved in medical monitoring and vaccination are considering evacuating the island and leaving it as a possible site for a new outbreak, said John Irwin, a U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases epidemiologist.\nHospitals are also counting on help from other countries but ""there has been more instances of deaths to be attributed to the #Coronavirus than exists in China, India and Southeast Asia,"" said Irwin.\nThe CDC report says that although China was involved in the U.S. migrant population, it is not necessarily part of the chain that led to the outbreak. The disease is hard to diagnose.\nThe U.S. government spokesman told reporters on Friday the agency plans to charge the government $11 million to transport patients and admitted members of the U.S. military to doctors\' offices. The U.S. was limited to providing vaccinations for the medicine in its treatment centres but might request more funding, he said.\nCare in port\nThe physician\'s clinic Aafia Siddiqui has experienced huge challenges in removing bone-injuries in the Philippines.

The government also designated the village where the couple were staying and told the woman not to visit.\nAuthorities say that they are doing everything possible to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and answer questions from media.

82,Trump extends federal social distancing guidelines to April 30,"['WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has granted the first legal recognition for a national social distancing organization — a recognition meant to aid transgendered people who live in the U.S. Freedom from Prejudice Coalition’s (FPC) 40 year national “Appeasement Plan.”\nIn a letter to the group, the first outreach challenge to Trump’s 2018 “zero tolerance” for anti-LGBT hate crimes, FPC co-founder Lisa Feldman announced that the administration has granted the organizational certification to Equanimity Network.\nFeldman’s two-page letter — titled “evidence supporting Expanded US Security Sec. 1016 (Response 41): “We extend the receipt of the certification to businesses, organizations, individuals and organizations in the #AmericaFirst Campaign” — also featured a letter from federal law enforcement officials, including the FBI, who warned against “pursuing unfair, discriminatory, disproportionate or degrading sexual orientation or gender identity” against those motivated by anti-LGBT hatred.\n“That’s why the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, the U.S. Marshals Service, and the Equal Rights Campaign are putting forth the names of Equanimity Network and [about] 400 other organizations with this certification this week,” said CUNALLs Executive Director Patrick Burns.\n“As a result of our collaborative efforts to enforce federal protection of LGBTQ individuals in the early stages of their legal process, Equanimity Network has been recognized by the administration.”\nU.S. Attorney Angela O’Malley in 2017 introduced the FPC Accountability Act, which in 2017 expanded the scope of the federally recognized “No Gay, No Bisexual, or Transgender Man Behind the Curtain” (NORWALT) and “APEC/UNICUECAY” initiatives that federal agencies are required to uphold as required under the Social Distress Act.\nFPC was formed in 2001, and has conducted campaigns over the years — including a campaign for the “Stop Trump” movement against immigrants. The FPC also has operated nationally since 2012 and annually has released a 70-page statement, a newsletter and a social media effort.\nIn his letter, Burns warned that inclusion of positive goals in the Framework Report on National and Institutional Advancement (FISA) is an important component of the Trump administration’s effort to roll back the fight against LGBT discrimination.\n“For some years, the president has claimed that ‘it’s easier to say you hate Mexicans.’ That’s been true,” Burns said. “But his persistence in not going to ignore ongoing federal protections of people who were transgendered, the people that you reported hate crimes against, the people who were targeted by homophobic hate groups. It’s been clear from the beginning that nothing could ever be done that hasn’t come down to this.”\n“It’s clear to me that for conservatives, the new focus of our 2016 campaign was on dispelling basic falsehoods that we had used for decades to promote equality for LGBTQ people in our nation,” Burns added. “In that effort, it was motivated by the disappointment and doubt that we had when we reported against this misinformation, and I am pleased that the administration has let us speak out publicly for the second time in less than two months.”\n']"
83,Fauci says Trump agreed not to invoke a strict quarantine after intensive White House discussions,"['Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell has said President Donald Trump agreed to withdraw the United States from a Russia-related ban on the more than 40 other countries that hold curfews with a certain level of level care.\nTrump, who insisted that he was talking only about Russia, waived last week’s ban, which has since been extended until Dec. 31, 2018, at the request of its director. Burwell said on Monday that Trump had no choice but to implement the decision, and after a meeting this week with Trump, she said that the president agreed to withdraw U.S. from Russia in the spirit of normalcy and cooperation.\nAccording to information obtained by USA Today, the USAFA and its sister organization, the America-Russia United Fund, agreed at the beginning of the week to preserve the ban in its entirety and to return to the U.S. The United Fund’s chief executive officer Samuel Koffman said Trump had directed that Trump appear before the Senate panel that will address Russia’s complaint about the partial closure of the U.S. market for Russian cyber security products.\nKoffman also added that a full investigation would be authorized by a letter and decision on an issue so urgent and sensitive as to give pause to America-Russia participants and investors.\nTrump and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on April 1 released a public warning that they had expanded the access of certain parts of the U.S. security apparatus to the Russian Foreign Ministry to help spur efforts to coordinate security across the nation. The warning was expected to have broad international repercussions. On Sunday, the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory and its research facilities have been reportedly ordered to remove certain materials they used from their research sites at Naval Research Lab in Laurel, Maryland, for vetting.\nThe move that preceded Saturday’s closings of the U.S. security apparatus to those countries effectively closed off the tech world for as long as possible to certain components of Russian client security systems that could be considered tactical against U.S. adversaries.\nThe officials of the labs, whose work included testing project strategies for cyber attacks and forensic analysis, declined to talk about the violation of national security, or to release any detail about the source of the threat that came from Russia.\nUS officials previously confirmed the U.S. intelligence community had concluded that Putin had tried to tip off the Trump administration of the compromising nature of his contact with the president, as detailed in a February 20 news article.\nOn Monday, the vice president’s office confirmed that Trump had also agreed to withdraw from the ban on seven countries that hold curfews with a specific level of level care, while the president’s office said he agreed not to do so, according to news reports.\nThe Trump administration will likely spend some time on developing a strategy for strengthening relations with Russia in light of its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and the preparation of the reset in relations with NATO members, as well as possibly redesigning the White House’s most powerful force on the continent, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.\nRepublicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have said that despite the threats emanating from Russia, it is “absolutely possible” that the president will be able to reverse last week’s action in the absence of concessions to Russian actors.

84,How long will Trump's poll surge last?,"['There has been a recent surge in the Electoral College vote across the US. Polls already show November elections among Democrats were competitive, or even close. There are more swing states. Now Donald Trump’s poll numbers aren’t expected to have been enough to put him over the top.\nAll eyes will turn to the Electoral College. Until last week, a new survey from the Quinnipiac University poll found that just one in 10 registered voters had cast a ballot in 2017.\nTrump’s latest figures and the increased pressure on him are not making him any closer to the likes of Bernie Sanders or Ted Cruz. Polls have been on for months and they have long been seen as key to his rise in American politics. He often calls the polls “pigskin polls” and said that the numbers were only showing the outside world.\nNobody really expects the outcome of future elections to turn out the way Polls were predicting last year. A Democratic majority is unlikely to hold if Trump continues to poll better than some projections have suggested. Polls suggest a Democratic majority for at least a decade. Polls before and after Trump poll shows that if he succeeds as president, there will be major voter pressure on him. He will therefore continue to coast to victory.\nTracking Trump’s electoral numbers is a tougher job than in most polls and, if he does succeed as president, the race will remain tight.\nPolls have been on for months, but polls look like Trump’s most important remaining factor. Whatever voters decided were true to Trump’s beliefs might have been seen as good news. Trump and his supporters are unhappy with the press, of course, with the social media coverage of Democrats and that. Trump blames “fake news” for these problems.\nBut Trump will continue to move ahead on Election Day, potentially faster than most voters thought, and so it won’t be pretty for him. Polls show that voters are taking note. They still think he has done a very good job of running Donald Trump World. But they are very seriously worried that what was publicly recorded might show.\nFor the pollsters, Donald Trump’s falling electoral numbers in the recent election cycle suggests an adjustment in their preferred polling figures. Trump has added more registered voters than any other Republican in history, but so far these voters are concerned that Trump’s electoral numbers might fall to no more than an Obama+ Democrat-3, or close.\nHowever, if Donald Trump continues to take a big swing across the globe, he is a natural candidate to get over the net: a representative and elected democracy. When polls are so low, Trump’s gains in the unlikely event that the Electoral College is dominated by a Democrat, the change will really benefit the candidate: a congressman, a congressman, or a president.\nThe candidate is not likely to make it through a few elections, but it doesn’t help his electoral future. If the presidential vote rises from a slim support of 21% to 31%, or Trump breaks 1% to vote for winner-take-all, or he falls to the plurality of voters, or Trump pulls below the Democrats in every possible battleground, it will be an extremely lengthy recount process in Europe and a losing effort by the Democrat governor of Virginia.\nThe foreign press is also putting pressure on Donald Trump. The idea that something bad can happen to him is a great deal more aggressive than the presidential election night result is currently showing. It’s so far behind the trend in other polls that I doubt any presidential candidate can count a fight to win over the remaining 50% or more before the tide is turning and it’s a free and fair election in 2020.\nIf Trump continues to thrive, with the election still very much a close election year, the Supreme Court could decide the matter in a major way. The decision might well be Trump’s turning in the direction that he has expressed his support for, at best, at worst, nothing more than his support for a lawsuit to block his presidency. If he reaches that, it would almost certainly save him a lot of political headaches.\n']"
85,"Pelosi on Trump's coronavirus response: 'As the President fiddles, people are dying'","['House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the Trump administration’s slow response to an outbreak of atypical coronavirus has left people dying.\n“Some people got sick, and it affects just like any other year,” Pelosi said in a Thursday evening appearance on the NBC Meet the Press. “And this time, it just looks like we’re having a coronavirus outbreak. It appears to be fueled by what we call the illness of choice.”\nPelosi has become a symbol of the White House’s failure to protect the U.S. health system from the Zika virus. The disease, which is now spread over land, has the potential to be even more devastating than Zika. That’s because it causes a wide range of diseases.\nThere is no vaccine. Only 99 cases of Zika are reported, with every other year on average going to more than 200,000 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n“When you talk about how the public and people, the health workers, are dead, you talk about who is dead and who’s trying to infect people,” Pelosi said. “It’s absolutely ridiculous.”\nAs the White House prepares to face an inspector general’s report next week on the outbreak and its public response, the answers are coming. At a press conference on Monday, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas reported the CDC’s preparedness for the case was feeble.\nRelated: How can you avoid the Ebola crisis now that Trump is reportedly traveling abroad?\n“Well, we had no response, we had no response on the alert. Then we had no response to public health warnings on the ground,” Cruz said. “The CDC had no response. So let’s ask them for their names.”\nThe Trump administration’s response should help avoid another outbreak, Cruz added.\n“It would be super powerful if it were implemented and actually something happened, and it was clear enough in the intelligence it wasn’t ready,” Cruz said. “It is going to have terrible and dangerous consequences. And the worst case scenario is that this becomes a devastating issue.”\nBut all of this is far from over.\nA report issued this week by the CDC predicted the outbreak could generate 1.7 million new cases this year, leaving the U.S. with 750 million more cases. The Trump administration’s failures have created strong opposition across party lines.\nTexas Senator and Texas Republican Representative John Culberson said the president’s refusal to answer questions about the report has left the country without a unified response.\n“How can you continue to cover up something and not admit that?” Culberson said. “Is not the responsibility of all of us to not sit down and say, why is this in our health system when we have such a functioning system?”\nThe administration has planned four days of meetings with health care providers in the coming days. Only 64 percent of those attending attended meetings with the White House said they believe the Trump administration is ready to respond, according to the poll released Wednesday.\nAsked if the administration’s long-promised response was a “good idea,” 64 percent of those surveyed said it was, and there are almost a third fewer people in America infected with the virus than expected. Another 16 percent said they have never gotten sick with Zika, and 7 percent said they don’t know.\nWLKY (video of the president)\nRelated: Trump hails progress in air-quality fight\nThat increased understanding helps put together a triage plan designed to meet the number of cases expected to arise.\nPublic health officials nationwide will hold a two-day summit to study the issue. With increased awareness across the country about the virus and concerns about Zika, the summit is expected to help ensure public health is prepared.\n“We’re very happy with the recovery,” said Julie Erenthal, deputy director of the Center for New-Schools Security. “All of these public health responders have improved dramatically, and with the resolution of Zika concerns, we’re moving forward.”\n']"
86,White House coronavirus task force has received proposed guidelines on reducing social distancing,"['The White House has commissioned a task force of experts to develop and publish guidelines for reducing social distancing from agencies that are firing up public conversation about the White House’s response to Ebola.\nIn a report released Monday morning, task force commissioners recommended targeting an environmental coalition formed by human rights groups, civil society groups, public health officials, and private providers as well as a government official to aggressively combat the spread of Ebola.\nThe White House led a mobilization of more than 70 media outlets to effectively end public conversation about Ebola.\n“The dialogue around Ebola, the response, and the lives lost continues to spark concern across the nation,” Donald Trump’s national security adviser H.R. McMaster said in a speech on Nov. 1. “Our Country wants to use this opportunity to get the country together.”\n“We are working to reduce the spread of Ebola through interventions that are effective, that can prevent others from carrying the virus or at least detect it before it enters our country,” the commission said in the report.\nThat might not be enough.\nInstead, to prevent stigma and confusion associated with the disease, policymakers need to take steps to implement environmental sustainability policies that are both socially inclusive and require policies to curb unnecessary and dangerous activity in public and private space.\nThe task force added that consumers need to “know not to use the term ‘use less,’ ” as well as those in telecommunications, streaming video, and electricity providers should be able to identify their actions that may occur within their network to ensure they do not pose a risk to other people.\nRelated Coverage Capacity for any Ebola response can be raised through transparency and less alarm\nThe report says only “preventative measures” might be appropriate to prevent Ebola, but it doesn’t recommend that eliminating or restricting the environment in which Ebola emerges has any bearing on how dangerous the disease can be.\nTransmitting saliva, or drinking fecal colostrum from a person, can lead to bleeding in or even death.\nEbola is spread by direct contact with bodily fluids and then infects the body. Millions are infected with the virus throughout the world, and most are living in West Africa.\nSince the U.S. began having Ebola, individuals infected with Ebola have been linked to outbreaks of illness in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea.\nThe Trump administration has long been criticized for declining to take a direct role in coordinating health policies between governments.\nSince 2016, the White House has released guidelines on how the White House and other agencies should deal with Ebola. There have been 112 potential state-level Ebola protocols developed and approved by agencies.\n']"
87,"9 takeaways from Tapper's interviews with Pelosi, Fauci, de Blasio and more","['The fashion insiders took a one-on-one chat with ABC\'s Diane Sawyer today and delivered 9 takeaways from their stories.\n1. It\'s been an interesting offseason for Trump. But it was equally interesting for Trump and the White House. On Trump, so many things have happened. Here are nine takeaways from her segments on the president.\nHeadlines in the world: It\'s hard to tell. So much about his life so many great quotes come off as just that, not that it\'s anything to do with the general public, what with New York Magazine tweeting, or how Trump and the show are trending on social media. But in the end, our veteran journalists needed to get up close to Trump and the issues he stands for. That helped me keep my perspective during his better times when the connections between Trump and Hillary Clinton were just too strong to ignore. Also, Dana Cooperman, George Papadopoulos and Marc Kasowitz were ready to get on the phone to ask Trump questions, like what to expect from an executive you\'ve never met.\n2. Will any of Trump\'s advisors work together? We\'re seeing what we\'ve written since ""Apprentice"" ended. For the most part, Trump\'s people always worked to get the show off the ground, first with former Apprentice competitors Todd Phillips and Fred Karger, then with presidential advisers and frontrunners Travis Kalanick and Dennis Hof. Rick Perry is holding that together. The last Trump budget process saw cuts in the departments they replaced, including much of his tax code. In his speech, he said the possibility of a presidency full of low taxes is a good thing. ""Asking real people what they want to be, no matter where you live, no matter what they think, is not the same thing as telling them what to do or where to go,"" he said.\n3. The Trump administration is not the only one at fault. This is a public relations issue that could get messier. The president seemingly won\'t take kindly to the constant distractions, emails and tweets from multiple White House staffers. A White House insider fired for pushing back against Trump would be misinformed.\n4. Trump\'s favorite cheerleader is not General Kelly. It\'s Kelly, or at least that coach from the Air Force One Air Force One. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has praised Kelly, who\'s retired from the Air Force. Sanders has also endorsed Trump. The soft-spoken White House insider even introduced Kelly\'s successor, Chris Christie, as the father of immigrants and struggles to provide strong safety nets. Both are standard fare for White House chiefs of staff.\n5. Obama and Trump confront each other on immigration. We\'re not going to discuss all the differences between Trump and Pence, if he represents the White House. But Trump has opened a flurry of punch lines to Kaine by saying Kaine has ""a lot of bad ideas."" Clinton\'s opponent, in particular, praises Kaine\'s integrity. Nonetheless, Clinton said Trump\'s refusal to meet with Mueller has given Florida even more hope for its investigation.\n6. He\'s very secure about Russia. What a president has to fear.

At this point, Kelly is mayor of New York City. How\'s that for a conspiracy theory? That means Trump has a very strong grasp of city hall. These days, it\'s a lot tougher than it was before 9/11. But the secret to his character, Trump said, is his ""defense of his policy process, his governing style."" Of course, that is important to Trump. This doesn\'t mean his policy and personnel are OK, but it just means he has a firm grasp of who should be implementing his strategy and how it fits in to the city\'s overall stability.\n8. Ha, pretty much. At some point, it\'s going to get ugly. Conservatives point to this as a clear indicator of the president\'s respect for the law, a lack of willingness to serve as an Army general, and an unwillingness to take on far-right challengers. But more than that, it also brings us back to one of our favorite examples: Trump and Kennedy.\n9. Looks like Bannon won\'t get a second hearing. Bannon will resume his media presence in January, well before the special counsel investigation comes to an end. But it\'s a reminder that it\'s only a month ago when former Trump strategist Steve Bannon finally publicly welcomed the investigation to the White House. Now that Trump\'s actually admitting that he was a part of the conspiracy, it\'s this plea for the court to close the impasse that keeps McConnell from fully wrapping the investigation around Bannon as it becomes the threat the president is trying to extricate himself from.\n']"

She told reporters that ""I think this is his America.""\nOn her State of the State tour, she used the best of rhetoric in public to kick off her visit in Michigan — a state whose population is under 100,000 — in a bid to show she was far more than just the person she is.\nRather than focusing on Trump\'s shortcomings as a person and a leader, Whitmer explored changes in ways that have sparked calls for Trump\'s resignation.\nOne criticism, in response to Trump\'s staff firing, has been that his acceptance speeches lack context. In recent months, Whitmer has spoken of her son as their surrogate, saying he spoke about their relationship between ""really great feelings"" and ""constructive action.""\nTrump may only have doubled down on that acceptance speech, Whitmer said, but they have this very moment where Trump is just behind us. ""That governor is me. That would be a good thing,"" she said.\n""That governor is me. That would be a good thing,"" she added.\nWhitmer also praised the attention her family has received for “Giving American High” banners in major cities and saying her family would have preferred to see a larger image that is more family-focused.\n""The first building of this town to do that, and that women should see was Washington, D.C.,"" she said. ""I think it’s important that you do that.""\nShe also praised Gov. Rick Snyder and praised Gov.

The Tory would have thrived, too. I won the Labour leadership before Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister.\nMs Thatcher became Prime Minister with a book by Barbara Hepworth, a unique political spin on the legacy of her husband\'s achievements. Her memoirs were often described as Diary of a Keir Starmer.\nDale Wilson, the MP who later served in the Brexit-warged government, pointed out that between 1980 and 1989, Mr Johnson had built the economy for seven consecutive years; Mr Trump said ""you only got one good thing for Britain"".\nThe Conservative party lost the public face of its vision, and Ms Thatcher\'s job approval rating was almost 75% at the time. Without a director of the prime minister\'s office, the Cabinet Office fell into chaos and became a government job, even allowing Philip Hammond to lead a department out of control of bureaucracy.\nMrs Thatcher helped to create an exceptional national interest campaign from which the Reformers could develop, recommending early action on immigration, housing and the removal of barriers on rail, roads and railways.\nThatcher inherited the legacy of British economic dependence, leaving an anti-colonialist legacy. She seized on the opportunity of the Thatcher era to take Britain out of the EU, and only fought to secure a better relationship with the US, but with a mixture of smarts and diplomacy.\nShe fought hard to strengthen Britain\'s economic ties with its world partners. In 1985, she signed the on- and off-us agreement with the Commonwealth, a deal that spurned the UK\'s membership of the EU and devised a template for how countries could work together in the future.\n']"
91,A breakdown of false and misleading statements at Trump Rose Garden briefing,"['New photo showing President Donald Trump during his first press conference at the Rose Garden\nSome false and misleading statements were made at the Rose Garden briefing that President Donald Trump attended in the morning, according to reports Wednesday.\nThe most recent statement from the White House contradicts previously released evidence that showed Trump received part of the order to halt all Muslim travel to the United States. It also falsely stated the exact number of visa applications that were being granted.\nStory Continued Below\nThe reports came weeks after Trump in the Rose Garden declared that he was suspending the signing of a two-year cooperation agreement with the Treasury Department so it could continue to help U.S. banks detect money laundering in Iran and other terror-related entities.\nTrump’s statement did not include any details regarding the visa checks. His office later posted the statement on its site.\nSince the original tweet to announce the steps to halt all nonimmigrant travel to the United States was first reported by The Washington Post on Jan. 31, the White House has been in touch with the Treasury Department to determine what Trump meant when he said it was the most important ever.\nYou can watch the full story on Page 2 of the Trump White House timeline.\nThat White House reaction to the claim also contradicts the shared statement from Trump that Trump’s administration would not add a U.S. Muslim guest in the event of a terrorist attack. As explained by CNN, the U.S. has 55 members of the Society of Muslim History and Culture, the Muslim guest program in places like Hong Kong and Egypt. The program also operates under a fee, not the president’s initial plan for the visa checks.\nWhen Trump took office, the immigration and national security adviser, John Bolton, had been trying to present a narrative that would persuade opponents that the administration’s policies were in line with what’s at stake in the Middle East and other dangerous areas.\nHe did so by floating a four-page reference to what he called President Barack Obama’s “broken promise” that the administration would prevent the flow of violent extremism from reaching all the countries where it was actually banned — including Iran and the Northeast.\nBolton’s reference to possible U.S. Middle East targeting left some critics open to questioning. Trump’s own chief of staff, Reince Priebus, said the administration was considering bombing cruise missiles from aircraft, something the Pentagon has said it is “under no obligation to do” but the White House told Page 2 of his Sunday trip with the president.\nGARDNER: VERY HEADQUARTERS IN TRADE THE DAY BEFORE AND BEAT CRUSHED LAST\nBut on Thursday morning, the administration and its allies would not join with a Republican House leader to release documents showing the administration’s false claims about the bulk of the attacks on the United States in 2016.\nDemocratic Rep. Will Hurd, who represents Houston, Texas, said he would release copies of the transcripts that are almost identical to a statement made by the Republican Whip, Steve Scalise.\nHurd, a Louisiana conservative, issued a statement on Twitter, saying that the government would not release the transcript or the FBI’s handling of the case.\n""Where were the Republicans?"" he asked in an Instagram post. ""Brought stand down. Minis do not speak for this whole industry. Our friends who attacked us deserve the due process and proper scrutiny.""\nPrior to his press conference, Trump boasted that he was targeting ""Islamic terrorism,” but he actually said a lot more. The president declared at the podium that he was not asking anyone for money, a claim that was widely ignored by reporters and lobbyists.\nHurd was joined in his remarks by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who accused Trump of the Islamic State, calling it a “blind source.”\nBut Hurd’s statement did not change much of what he said at the press conference.\nHurd said he was not referring to the president during his press conference to inform Trump what information Trump was claiming from President Barack Obama’s administration.\n“I was not referring to the president,” Hurd said. “I was referring to President Obama, not President Trump.”\n']"

Last week, a subsequent notice that five people had been hospitalized and two more died left New York City in a precarious situation.\n""We\'re not asking anyone to attack the integrity of government,"" Bloomberg said. ""No one is going to treat New York any unfairly by coming into contact with this disease. But the fact is they are going to need more time to catch these people before the Department of Health and Disease Control and the Department of Environmental Protection agencies can handle the problem and have it stop immediately.""\nMerck notified New York\'s health commissioner Jan Murphy last week that five patients with pneumonia who had already turned up in its microbiomes were being treated by county health officials. The company said only one other of its cases were linked to illness.\nMorale is high but the sick patients are being treated far more effectively. Between 40 percent and 60 percent of the cases reported this year have come from cooperatives or other non-federal providers, Bloomberg said. The province of Canada and British Columbia have also instituted similar measures.\nThe respiratory threat has been on the rise since first appearing in 1957, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Infections with coronavirus infections have increased by 5.1 percent since October, the worst monthly jump since 1948. In 1992, it was 5.4 percent.\nLast month, three people died after contracting the virus in Canada — through immunizations and hospitalizations.\nNew York Health Secretary John Miller visited Hong Kong on Tuesday to discuss the outbreak.\n""The outbreak is shocking, it\'s tragic,"" Miller said at a news conference. ""How quickly this starts causes our children and seniors, and children and young adults to become symptoms of the disease is something that takes several days to get to our attention.""\nChristie\'s Health Insurance plan allows up to 568 people to buy health insurance through an exchange that can offer up to the same coverage as the private market.\nHealth insurance policies have defined a list of vital symptoms as severe, chronic or irreversible damage to an individual\'s physical and mental health, chronic overuse of antibiotics, excessive colds, serious respiratory problems and other illnesses.\nConsumers should be worried about how much coverage may be available, but those in the health insurance market will still have access to coverage. You will not need to plan for the disease\'s symptoms — such as chest pains, constant coughing, fever, cough, rapid weight loss, decreased appetite and other illnesses.\n""What we\'re calling the \'family health insurance\' is only reasonable if you buy it on the individual level, with lower deductibles, that plan is written as a calendar year plan and will see you getting a lot more coverage,"" Miller said.\nWhile the New York Health Department has now identified other illnesses at risk, the deluge of cases — which Bloomberg called ""a steady, recurring system"" — is the first part of a larger scheme to reduce the spread of the disease, Bloomberg said.\nThe state\'s order gives officials more flexibility. It will allow individuals in hospitals or clinics not already covered to continue purchasing coverage for new and healthy patients.\nAdditionally, another early warning sign that New York may have a case of the respiratory virus is the state Health Department notifying providers of the illness.\n""This order keeps the citizens of New York safe and healthy,"" Bloomberg said.\nThe health department got much more time to deal with the outbreak than could have been initially hoped.\nIt has sent recommendations to the feds, and is using the pandemic information it collects to help identify possible individuals who have a particularly dangerous strain of the respiratory virus.\n']"

The Government of the United States, if the rates move up, I know very well that will add to the hole that exists in government coffers,” Mnuchin said in an interview.\n“I mean look, that’s a tough situation we’re in, and there has been anxiety all around, especially around the financial system.

But he said the comment wasn’t that they share his concerns about China and was a tacit acknowledgement that they are “having some kind of a hard time” engaging. He referred to “some good things” like the proposed partnership in education.\n“They think they are earning the revenues that’s so important to them that they are going to move assets out of their business that they don’t really like, and that they’re going to bring back some of the tax revenues that they would have brought back. What is it that they are going to bring back?” Trump said.\nBut the American president made his comments clearly aimed at China in order to appease the Chinese, which began a trade war after Trump declared war on domestic Chinese companies. China’s January trade surplus with the U.S. fell to $233 billion, down 11 percent from a year earlier.\nIndeed, in February, all three major U.S. export industries — apparel, auto parts and construction — all shuttered from Trump’s visit. Beijing’s foreign trade surplus fell to just $86 billion from $78 billion in March.\nBut Trump seems keen to point out that its economy is just one aspect of the U.S.’s “global,” trade deficit with China.\nTrump’s administration has targeted China in the past to soothe concerns about its slowing economy, escalating trade conflicts and general domestic concerns about China’s negative impact on the U.S. economy. In January, China stepped up its defense of American trade and energy cooperation to counter possible U.S. intentions to stimulate growth, and at the same time was projecting some harsh U.S. economic retaliation.\nThe U.S. has also repeatedly brought China into the global debate over who ought to be in charge of the world’s biggest economy. It has imposed economic sanctions and economic open-door policy on Beijing as Beijing looks to bolster its exports.\nMeanwhile, China continues to see an opportunity to become a majority stakeholder in U.S. manufacturing, cutting taxes on imports. That could also help Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and lessen scrutiny from some investors.\n']"

You can’t have a federal intervention, you can’t have a state control over marijuana, you can’t have a state attorney general position. That would imply a regressive prohibition.”\nA spokesman for Schneiderman declined to comment on the executive order.\nAn article in USA Today on Tuesday indicated that state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman plans to push back the time limit for investigation of state-run medical marijuana dispensaries – or those in the legal system, if they do so – before the legislation passes.\n']"

100,"One nation, under coronavirus: How two weeks changed America","['One of the reasons that US senator Heidi Heitkamp has helped lead President Donald Trump’s populist wave in the past few months has been that he is so focused on creating jobs that he doesn’t get much of anything right. Heitkamp, a Democratic North Dakota senator and fellow likely presidential candidate for 2020, has had a promising start. In May, the Democratic National Committee broke new ground by referring to China as the “second happiest country in the world.” That marks the strongest connection we’ve seen between the Trump administration and North Dakota Senator Heitkamp, a fiscally conservative Republican who is not afraid to balance the nation’s budget.\nOn election night, the Trump administration threw support behind two new projects, Keystone XL and South Dakota’s Dakota Access oil pipeline, which President Trump reversed the previous administration’s decision to block, throwing plenty of ammunition into the national politics. Its very existence underscores its central role in moving American energy policy forward, as President Trump has warned that his administration has the potential to put our energy security at risk. There are several issues America might not know how to confront and much of its future depends on it.\n* * *\nEverywhere in the country, trends and analogies turn in different directions, the opposite of what the political pundit knows what to do. Predominantly Democratic-leaning states like North Dakota and South Dakota are all looking to the present, fighting on ideological grounds to revive those populations that have been fighting in the Civil War for centuries. Some are joining the Fight for the Future movement of 20 states, including New York and California, fighting for their own liberty and rights, and pushing for collective control of major corporations and the financial system.\nBut there are also others in states where states are choosing to spend less than they did under the Obama administration, when they joined the Democrats for the first time, and looking for ways to force progressive change.\n* * *\nAmerican voters should be able to tell which new, helpful project they would like to take on, based on what it would cost America. Like any new proposal, it must:\n—Establish a national crisis fund to begin collecting the money to cover all the costs of the Trump administration’s programs for the next five years\n— Require Congress to delay its vote on the war in Iraq unless it can ascertain that its postwar response to the global crisis can be completed and not be reversed.\n— Increase the energy investment for the Pacific Northwest; let Washington use its tax advantages to cut greenhouse gas emissions from California\n—Promote cross-border trade by releasing information on fossil fuels that would help the countries negotiate new renewable energy options\n— Raise the price of cigarettes and other products.\nThe final drop-off from Democrats would go on to a recurring theme: From energy to job to infrastructure, officials from both sides insist that the politics of development is not an alternative. President Trump has an unrealistically powerful populist message, so the anxiety among voters may be misplaced. Trump has an agenda, and the most ambitious plan will depend on education and urban energy sources.\nThose themes will be out for the long haul, especially if they materialize in states where Democrats are lukewarm about cutting taxes and spending on wasteful government spending. If nothing else, these matters underscore the trouble Americans are having with a combination of dysfunctional government and a slow-mo population. They trust Trump’s instincts — as opposed to the consensus solutions that conventional politics offers.\nWe may soon see some changes in our political lexicon, however, as progress on trade, and other issues, trickle down to traditional Democrats and Republicans. President Trump might have disappointed many, too, if he hadn’t taken so much his supporters by surprise in 2017 with his controversial tariffs on Chinese imports, which are not their core constituency. At the same time, Trump may also have alienated millions of people by not meeting them and scoffing at their suggestions for unity. If Trump’s tolerance for outside influences was infectious and ever-predictable, there’s no reason to believe there would be other audiences waiting to see what comes next. If a new progressive president didn’t inspire a surge of support for his whole-spectrum agenda, no one’s going to be surprised that he lost the primaries.\n']"

But it’s a model that also has implications for healthcare innovation.\nLoyola University Chicago School of Medicine researchers and Massachusetts General Hospital researchers have been conducting open lab studies on the culture and environment of Covidrol-branded vehicles. They uncovered workers’ lack of basic medicine. Quality scores were high or low. Part of the reason for this was there was no cardiologist or doctor available for the test.\nA growing shortage of basic supplies isn’t stopping Covidrol testing from expanding from Chicago to other parts of the country. The company is looking at becoming a part of Harvard Medical School for new types of healthcare tests. Part of this new approach is to join a growing center of medical innovation in Denver, Colorado, and on the West Coast.\nThe goal is to reach market “to reveal, as U.S. states do, the extent to which a second, smaller labor pool of doctors is enabling consumers to understand and understand better the health of their health,” says Arlene Myers, a spokesperson for Research Affiliates, a healthcare innovation firm with offices in Denver and Los Angeles.\n']"

The visit took place before the stream of anxious US officials began to pray for a possible Ebola treatment for Ebola victims in West Africa.\nWithout official announcements or contact details, a statement released by Trump and Periotis stated, “This is a very important day for the people of Suriname. It is a reminder that the risk to other human beings is grave and that anyone having contact with these persons should take urgent action in identifying and treating them. “This important act of solidarity was planned during the days of uncertainty when the monster of Ebola suddenly metastasized in the US.”\nThe move to confront the Zika virus or hepatitis B virus, as the US treatment does, have also raised alarm. Suriname is one of 10 Caribbean countries worldwide where mosquito-borne viruses such as Zika and Guillain-Barre can be transmitted by contact with stool samples that people have using the faeces of infected people. The virus was widely spread through the air and is now no longer found in the US public.\nThe first cases reported of Ebola in the US were an outbreak in August 1999 in San Antonio and in January 2016, when Swine Flu from Norway was discovered in California and spread quickly into the US.\nShare this: Tweet\n']"

This is an extraordinary claim. While the president has pledged not to make any gestures, he has vowed to try to derail the trip by avoiding the sight of a crisis over the number of American citizens killed by North Korea’s nuclear program.\nAfter getting his news feed, reports of Chinese overtures and announcing that North Korea had met the president and team of trade and political officials, the rest of the world weedy, as usual.\nFrom what Trump called on Monday morning, the panic of the last two weeks began immediately. The Chinese economy (apparently) has begun to slow down and fears are growing again of the imminent arrival of a U.S. attack on Pyongyang.\nBeijing and Washington were supposed to discuss what Trump and Vice President Mike Pence could do to prevent a dangerous clash, but it’s another (continuing) turn of events that took the United States by surprise.\nTrump is not called on to support the sovereignty of China at this point, but he has called on Trump to do so himself. That problem is not addressed as fully to the deal we announced today, but Trump is forced to make his offer and face even more opposition than he did the previous time, and the Chinese has to pay him a price first.\nThe delays are from due to unexpected, unexpected events, and the two sides try to keep things moving forward despite that, so what happens next is everyone’s business.\n']"

He made a joke about it when he told members of Congress he would boost spending on infrastructure spending.\n“I’ll tell you, however, that I thought the sky was going to fall, we’d start to have huge deficits and debt, and so I’m going to take a chance,” Mr Trump said.\nHe said there would be no increase in the debt either. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) had projected a further decline in the debt over the next decade.\nThe president said he was planning a major plan to overhaul the tax code for the middle class to boost incomes and jobs and benefit the middle class.\nIn other news, Trump gave a rare interview on a town hall with an audience of television news anchors at George Washington University’s Whitewater ranch, in White Sulphur Springs, Mississippi.\nThe president had cheered at times when he appeared before the students, initially huffing at his critics, but after an hour or so of the much-needed in-depth conversation about the Gulf Coast economy, he heard pro-business messages.\n“Things are going great and the impact of all of this is going to be significant in the long run. It’s not a stretch to think that there will be bumps in the road that are going to take some time. I’ve got to show the people that I’m serious,” he said.\nOn the European continent, Trump called for unity and a stronger single currency.\n']"

No insurance company has been able to find the safety information to allow them to establish the means of an airline recovery. Nearly 12,000 airline passengers die in the US every year due to injuries related to airborne coronavirus infection.\nThe symptoms that caused the death and the complications can be dangerous but everyone is on alert. Last month, Forbes magazine labeled New York City’s New York City area as “the worst airport in the U.S.” Recently, the DOT postponed a new runway plan for the island city as testing this year found the soil on top of the airship was contaminated.\nThe five airports selected to be hurt by the pathogen are up for sale. Six to eight are expected to be up for sale this year. On March 29, planes loaded with passengers were grounded. A disaster relief center was set up at the Aspen Skiing Resort.\nBusinessWeek, citing a New York Times report, found:\n*Deadly dengue fever: 184 people have died across the US from the virus so far this year, nearly half from D.C., compared with 119 the year before.\n*Nina Wolfertitis: 458 people, including 74 children, have died so far in Northern California, about 40 percent from their childhoods.\n*Hadillitis: 351 people have died, including 89 children, about half as many as last year.\n*Cardiac illnesses: 20, including 63 from N.J., North Carolina, Florida, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Utah, New York, Puerto Rico and Washington\n*Miami respiratory disease: 80 people, including six children, died this week, nine days after being treated at an emergency room, especially for respiratory infections.\nThe virus typically infects the respiratory system of people, but can also spread through other means.

FDNY officials say they have set up 36 emergency room beds on Long Island and Broward, Florida and nine on Miami-Dade County in Broward County.\nOf the 130,000 passengers admitted so far this year to Chicago’s O’Hare, only 1,356 have been diagnosed with the disease, according to a survey released last week by Flush, an airport organization.\n“There are a lot of questions still to answer at ground level,” said Matthew Brennan, an airline spokesman in the Long Island Port Authority, a federal agency that monitors and rules airports. “There are probably millions of passengers, flights and facilities that haven’t been adequately tested at this point.”\nAirports have delayed or canceled flights in some areas due to the travel sickness.\nOfficials in Minneapolis did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why a city study is delaying launching a new runway for the city-owned airport.\n“Going forward, we will be coordinating and working with the airports in metro Buffalo, Denver, Orlando, California, Chicago, and Oakland to make sure they have sufficient resources to support operations when we have an outbreak or large case,” the city said.\nKenneth Feinberg, the US Treasury Department’s nominee to oversee airline recoveries, said his agency was now “moving quickly to suspend a list of pending cases for travel by air.”\nBrennan argued that airlines have been unable to identify an underlying cause of the outbreak, which began in mid-2017 and became so widespread that health officials are now hopeful it would disappear and restore safe air travel through 2020.\nOfficials report that outbreaks in Mexico and Taiwan have persisted.\nThe Florida outbreak also prompted President Donald Trump to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement.\nTrump’s order drew a sharp response from some of his long-time allies.\n“Americans are now questioning the timing of this decision, and why he has disregarded the just-concluded test of the EPA,” Trump wrote on Twitter on March 30.\n“The January test was beyond NASA!”\n']"

On Monday, President Donald Trump announced that, on the whole, he will call the tax-relief package, which will help the families of veterans receive even more money for their pets, a perk Obama supported in 2009.\n""We can\'t lose sight of where America needs it most, which is vets - especially military veterans and their families who have loved ones they care about,"" Trump said in a statement.\n""President Obama is right, as we saw with the financial rescue packages, that vets deserve help because America is great.""\nThe White House said the package will be made available on Monday.\nNeither the White House nor Congress have a budget for the spending bill, so these packages\' impact is not included. Their future is at risk for a further fight.\nThe Administration is again on its par with Obamacare and, true to its word, in doing all it can to remove the cap on tax credits, which helps roughly 150,000 couples across the country. This program, which goes back to the creation of the GOP health care bill in 2010, was always intended to be a salve to the political damage of having a healthcare plan managed by Democrats.\n(Aside from this Obamacare ploy, only one thing the White House did stand out from the rising number of other high-profile measures this year is to tax seniors at a lower rate than they had in 2010; Obama insisted the bills were too low, so it happened that they didn\'t)\nAlong with this socialistic tax package, among other things, Trump wants to slash the amount of tax they can deduct from their paycheck, something taxpayers should do to reduce their taxes. Republicans have already suggested tapping into the Social Security payroll tax for these taxes, but they aren\'t done yet.\nAnother White House proposal that could help grow our economy is a proposal for another proposal that increases the number of people eligible for the tax deduction. This too, was an Obama-era initiative. What it does offer is smaller rates on the rest of your paycheck, then a lower standard deduction.\nIn 2014, Barack Obama\'s presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, proposed that single filers, especially those married (or partnered) couples, who are eligible for the standard deduction could see their family\'s taxes rise 20 percent. If that were happening, people who were married could also deduct those previous income taxes. It was an encouraging idea, though, and something that Obama could learn from.\nThe result of a proposed Obama-Clinton tax reform would be the ""starting tax break to help people make a larger jump into the middle class,"" and it would undoubtedly help the most-advantaged families.\nThis article originally appeared on WND.com.\n']"
107,What's in the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill,"['PITTSBURGH (AP) — Politicians from across Washington and elsewhere are scrambling to preserve the $2 trillion package under consideration in Congress that would offset the expected rise in global disease costs.\nThe trio of bills contains no poison pills, but at least one could make it into the final legislation.\nThe biggest is a $2.2 trillion universal health coverage subsidy, a key condition of the Obama-era health care law that economists predicted would soon be wiped out. Also included in the bill are steps to stabilize the global insurance market and measures to boost the minimum wage.\nKey provisions include minimum wages. A proposal backed by Rep. Maxine Waters is expected to attract strong Republican backing. Representative Mike Simpson of Florida, a co-sponsor, says it is an important step toward expanding coverage to 1.2 million uninsured Americans who don\'t need it and keep getting coverage. But the Democrats in Congress have yet to deliver on the desired change in coverage and those who oppose it say the policy might backfire.\nIllinois Rep. Barbara Lee sees the bipartisan bill as the ideal bill to help the uninsured. Over the past year, she has introduced several pieces of legislation to help pay for the universal insurance program. Some of the ideas, including expanded Medicaid, have been endorsed by Republicans.\n""At this point, the push is really, I think, good,"" Lee told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. ""It\'s also going to mean we\'re at the starting line in terms of broader reforms.""\nTrump had a harder time selling the GOP\'s ""health care alternative"" to legislation he called unfit for existence last year. Since then, various Republican-led efforts have been foiled by Trump voters struggling with empty prescriptions and costly plans.\nCongressional Republicans nearly passed a similar bill in 2014, but it failed to overcome Democrats\' opposition to offering tax credits to help people pay their medical bills.\nThe Republicans also started working on a massive repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\nLee and Feinstein cited Obama\'s health care law as the reason that about half of newly insured people didn\'t sign up for coverage.\nNow, the Democrats have pushed for a measure aimed at boosting the status quo by overhauling existing federal requirements for medical bills, including using the economy to pay for them.\nThe Democratic-led Senate has yet to act on the bill, while the House can\'t vote.\nWith Americans under age 45 and covered under the law, Medicaid will be provided by private plans that carry similar coverage as Medicare. The House isn\'t considering a plan that would expand Medicaid or prevent other conservatives from cashing in on a push for a tax on health insurance.\nAlthough Democrats haven\'t given up their promise to issue legislation this year that would turn private insurers over to government, they have a tight line on how it could come into effect, raising the risk that those individuals could have few options.\nRepublicans control the Senate, but only if they can successfully pass a legislative effort over their objections. And conservatives have balked at giving a deal to the Republican-led House until Republicans have first addressed coverage.\nStill, Lee said she\'s hopeful conservatives will move in 2016 after the election. And the new health care bill would eliminate millions of those barriers, she said.\nSupporters of the universal insurance program say the policy would lower health insurance costs by offering tax credits for people to buy into an affordable insurance plan. But Republicans say it would only help poor people or pregnant women who aren\'t already covered by other programs.\nFor government-run health plans, the biggest cut would come from individuals or families, which are paid to buy insurance through a marketplace but must contend with the growing numbers of people who don\'t qualify for subsidies.\nDemocrats say they are also concerned about the loss of protections that protect health coverage for low-income people.\nTrump, as governor of Florida, threatened to end them in 2015. He is known for seeking hefty sums of money from insurance companies to secure insurance for himself and his family, but the GOP-controlled Congress says that\'s a justifiable sacrifice to protect the public option, which would govern coverage in states with popular plans.\n""That program is dead,"" Lee said. ""We\'ve gone too far in looking for support for health insurance.""\n___\n']"

His youngest son is one of one.\nExperts believe that in a pandemic, the severe form of avian flu, a severe form of flu, could lead to the fatal non-Hodgkin\'s lymphoma. The first pandemic of 2017 wasn\'t initially a type two, a type three, though early results show improvement. The number of patients diagnosed in New York City, Rhode Island and Boston fell from 35 to 12, but far fewer patients in the severe form, which tends to spread quickly.\nIn a CNN op-ed Wednesday, Jill Abramson said that ""the elder Trump gets a lot of attention, but this administration did put some thought into this response.""\n2. There\'s still a time for a vaccine.\nAlthough doctors predict that there\'s enough vaccine available to inoculate an average of 11 million people this year, there are some reasons why it\'s not possible, with a shortage of suitable doses and the need for more, noted New York Times senior reporter Brian Stelter, who covered the Valdez incident.\n""In the event of an event like the Valdez, how much of that are you going to get and what\'s the best vaccine you\'re going to get, you can\'t tell, but that\'s why it\'s really difficult for us to process the data like we can manage in the current [Hennepin County hospital] system,"" he said.\n3. Altiplano isn\'t perfect.\nThe National Institutes of Health report found that Altiplano offers ""complete protection"" against avian flu, even with tiny amounts. There\'s no known vaccine for this respiratory strain, but researchers suspected it might work by treating a candidate among the available strains.\n""We discovered it could be very useful for surgical applications in very acute respiratory infections,"" Jim Denning, the lead study author and deputy director of the National Immunization Program, told the media on Wednesday. ""One of the most exciting pieces of development is the potential to determine how accurately we can help to treat this potentially fatal strain through the studies that we have started.""\n4. His idea of a viral antidote is different from his predecessor\'s\nWhat\'s more, Biden said, ""I know what I did with vaccine in 1963 when I sat in a position to do it.""\nHe suggested getting some of the vaccine manufactured in a lab or by youandthemselves, which would make it easier to receive an opioid shot.\n5. Chief of staff John Kelly spoke his mind.\nWhile on his way to the White House on Wednesday, Vice President Kelly told reporters that he was ""deeply saddened"" by the deadly outbreak and encouraged others to come forward with tips on how to protect their loved ones.\n']"

The new model, reportedly designed to help customers save as much as $120 million a year, will allow homeowners to choose the type of solar panel they want using the most energy, in a way that rivals that of anything like a car.\nFauci\'s company is nowhere to be found in the newest green form of energy from renewable sources, and they\'re of the view that someone like Trump could help it achieve. The solar-electrician president, the company\'s founder and principal, is a billionaire who has created dozens of environmental companies around the globe, most notably an eco-friendly company named Sunrun that sells solar power.\nTrump is a billionaire whose shares rose following his election victory. His latest strategy was to install a private company (Model E) in a steel building in Manhattan.\nCritics of the offer, such as the New York real estate mogul\'s Canadian colleague Brian White, think the Trump approach has only added fuel to Fauci\'s popularity. Trump himself suggested in an interview with the Boston Globe that his intentions to build solar energy didn\'t reflect what will be the cost of a big wind-power project in Trump\'s backyard, and that he may have ""no plans"" to undertake the government-backed Sunrun.\nFauci was on the receiving end of White\'s comments in a conversation last month. At the time, Fauci told the Globe he thinks the state of New York\'s electric grid isn\'t great, but that ""as far as wind and solar are concerned, we\'re clean.""\nNow Trump is dabbling in the issue of renewable energy. The White House is reportedly looking into solar power, which Fauci\'s company has made public.\nIt\'s not clear if the White House is involved in the project. More recently, Trump has advocated for investment in renewable energy in his first six months in office, touting it as an important industry.\n']"
114,One Louisiana hospital is using brown paper bags by the ICU doors to store used masks,"['× One Louisiana hospital is using brown paper bags by the ICU doors to store used masks\nLOUISIANA, La. — The first 9-year-old schoolboy leukemia patient who was the target of medical staff’s racist statements was saving his health from being buried in a layer of brown paper in a room.\nNearly a year ago, four children of Polygon Medical Center in Louisiana received dangerous health-care orders from the Black Panther Party, according to a family advocacy group.\nDocs told the patients’ families there were “Racist Zulu” and would “kill” black patients.\nIn the U.S., medical staff routinely help patients understand the original order, Dr. Sylvia Rahal said, but they still ask patients for personal identification cards so doctors can select specific painkilling treatments.\n“Now there’s panic and panic in the system … and they say, ‘Take a picture,’ ” Rahal said. “They feel we need to make decisions that can take care of patients.”\nThe son’s mother, Elaine Siegel, is now breathing on brown paper bags, along with the other patients, after a hospital-issued seven-year-old therapy patient referred to doctors from the hospital said he had needed “some medicine” and was finally given time to rest.\n“When it all started, [the treatment] was fine,” Elaine Siegel said in a videotaped interview. “The heart didn’t really drop.”\nThe mother said the high-risk patients had no food, had no medication and didn’t have any medication for their blood cancer. The brothers’ parents told several medical managers that they were scared to visit them with their four other children in pain after being told some of them were identical to their mental illness.\nFortunately, Elaine Siegel said the doctors appeared to be doing their job, and she spent about a week at Polygon General where she started to feel better.\n“They allowed me to sit and rest,” Elaine Siegel said. “They’re just sweet babies.”\nOther families who heard about the incidents also set up a GoFundMe page where funds were raised to cover costs for the families’ transition of of the four children from Polygon to Polygon.\nElaine Siegel said she is a proud “lawyer,” though she doesn’t understand why doctors would fear to speak about an image of her sons.\n“You’re an every man for himself. We don’t want to be biased,” Elaine Siegel said. “You’re treated with respect, and I just worry that maybe people do not see you as your own person.”\n']"
115,Can your marriage survive the coronavirus?,"['Cathay Pacific - Focus on your marriage and personal lives. Well known institution of family care. Every wedding and family benefit to those who have the training and experience necessary to face that, when it comes to raising a family. The reality is there are other families out there. There are many full on on retirees trying to save for retirement. The time to look is now.\nI know my role as a part owner of a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange and which holds more than 6,300 shares of the board of directors. I am fiduciary to the company and spouse. I look after the succession planning and, when all is said and done, I do my very best to give my best.\nI get paid about 8 percent of sales based on the sales list. My year is significant. I have worked on four fronts, that is the highest management as far as my personal finances are concerned. However, the difference in salary will easily consume about 3 percent of sales.\nSo what happened to my career. In true ""Forbes"" fashion it is a business area that I shall gladly assume as the new professional norm. When it comes to marriage and family I can find several other steps that would have a big impact on my career. What about personal care or safety first?\nIn one of those public documents I believe nobody can read but that has already been posted to your website for ages and is subject to future modifications. What I can point out is that the faster you do this to your business (my estimates) the faster you are going to be able to push your personal care management skills to an an average of ten workdays per week. This could be only been through special training, more extensively in case necessary in the future.\nUnder pressure from political leaders and legal officials, I have managed to shed the custody of my child, raise the child with the help of me as well as my two daughters, while offering comfort to those who were expecting me. It was easier to file lawsuits against the parents because of the expertise of my business.\nWhat was done really saved my career as well. I won a DFW Innovation Prize and a commercial entity for my work. One big advantage was that the favor that the corporations did was lowered the profitability of that year. When a company named CNI loses a country to another, they replace their executive. It has been a fun career too but I will not downplay the main importance of financial management. I believe it should be mandatory as long as you are new or who the mother is.\nI am going to continue with my training and will tell you that on a personal level you can work pretty hard to keep your head above water. I will be honest, I worked hard to satisfy myself that my purpose was to meet the needs of my family (an almost individual family member) and that didn\'t look likely.\nAs to taxes, I don\'t think it will come up that much, my employer is already paying all of the taxes, but I can\'t stress enough the big money in taxes that probably may be felt for the first time since my start. I\'ll be specific in my tax plan in a much lighter form and the idea in this letter are for the first time I will be starting at zero in 2019. I will get my point across on how much in taxes I can avoid as well. The reason that that is so important is that I can play to my advantage as an employee by not being taxed more. I guarantee you my promises to you are perfect.\nIt has been amazing. The future is now in motion as I jolt you into work. I truly believe that by the time you are a full grown professional, your spouse could be your financial planner. You now have a partner who can remember what they want to do for them, and the things they want to keep. I\'m so excited about what will be happening and my time. The more this happens and the more it is, the more I can enjoy this next chapter as a professional.\n']"

117,Duke researchers are decontaminating N95 masks so doctors can reuse them to treat coronavirus patients,"['SUSQUEHANNA, Kan. (KSNT) – Duke researchers say they’re recovering data from more than 18,000 N95 masks produced in the past year.\nNow they want to take that data home and focus on the best available treatments.\n“It’s a lot of medication and a lot of drugs; clinical trials, proof of concept,” said Dr. Sue Browning, Duke Medical Center.\nOver 18,000 masks were produced in the past year from the National Institutes of Health and 18,033 of those were sold to doctors for a price in the region of $89 to $1,000 per mask.\nThe masks were sold during flu season, along with dummy and live shots for patients with coronavirus infection.\nThe results of these studies show that some patients fail to return to duty at work.\n“In those 57,073 masks that had been delivered with the recorded data, 96.1 percent of patients tested recovered. And then it was below 98 percent that we have processed the data,” Dr. Browning said.\nThe CDC says coronavirus requires four components:\nExposure to viruses\nImmunization to prevent virus transmission\nThe quality of the information received about the patient.\n“This was one of the factors that impacted when we gave new masks in the 90,000 masks,” Browning said.\nThe 2015-2016 flu season included several other errors and deaths that happened before the masks were shipped to the hospitals.\nThe hospitals that received the masks tested positive for coronavirus, but this study is allowing doctors to determine if the manufacturers can adjust the masks to their needs.\nSome doctors may want to bring back these masks to the doctors’ offices.\n“I’d love to think that if I knew earlier in the morning, I’d be able to resume working late hours. I’d be out more,” said Dr. Browning.\nBrowning says many schools have put the mask over until it’s safe to use for emergencies.\nShe added there could be a lot of red flags among schools.\n“There’s a lot of education campaigns that have been going on for the last couple of years and they’re made in schools but the schools that have these masks, there’s certain issues, some of them have been flagged as indicators of contamination,” Browning said.\nThe mask manufacturer declined to comment.\n']"
118,Cardiac injury among Covid-19 patients tied to higher risk of death,"['Covid-19 is a 5-year-old haematoma that symptoms typically include vertigo, tingling, fever, chills, aches and pains.\nThe CDAs are stents implanted into the front of the neck and left side of the neck, where they block the growths of tumor cells. But these implants pose little risk to patients\' health at first, and require a subsequent hysterectomy for each of the skin-beating conditions.\nStill, their complications persist — including poor circulation in the general population and long hospital stays — and researchers at the University of Bristol say they\'ve made progress in improving the outcomes of treatments. The incidence of infections among patients with CDAs increased by 10 to 15 percent over the past decade.\n""The problem is that it is so bad for patients that they might not even be able to go to an operation,"" says Dr. Rafi Bhagat, a pediatrician who works at Bristol to treat patients with CDAs. ""That is what the disparity is because, as you know, over-the-counter drugs are now being covered by consumer health insurance plans.""\nBecause surgical techniques may be more effective, it\'s perhaps not appropriate to use two-drug treatment in either side of the wound, added to improve overall outcomes. Instead, patients need to rely on a surrogate tissue other than the patient\'s own.\nTo cure the disease, the CDAs must be surgically implanted in the front of the neck. Though the therapy is potent, it\'s also replete with backache and sting problems.\nJelena Foulata, the director of the World Lung Foundation of America, says not enough of this treatment is recommended for patients currently on the short end of surgery, like smokers.\n""The treatment can be hard on the patient if they are on paper,"" she said. ""It might take them three months to actually get the bad end down. If they are going on surgery because they have high blood pressure and heart problems, then we don\'t want them going on surgery because we don\'t want to do that.""\nBhagat\'s team tested two treatment methods with ""plantable diuretics"" that involved inserting the mesh for a total of five weeks and then working one week into recovery. All eight patients had a CDAs implant within 10 days of deployment.\nOverall, approximately 1.7 percent of patients with CDAs had no effects on outcomes, Bhagat said.\nThe study of the frequency and duration of CDAs also found that fewer than half of patients in two-drug treatment groups needed follow-up or even a follow-up is needed to achieve acceptable results.\n""These CDAs allow us to improve our interactions with the patients,"" Bhagat said. ""We can see the positive side effects and as a result, there is less need for the side effects.""\nIn evaluating the use of high-dose mesh radiation, surgeons at the London Institute of Dermatology in the United Kingdom assessed cardiac life in six patients with CDAs.\n""They were very good with electrodes fitted into their skin,"" Bhagat said. ""They have a very good bed and their skin. Even though we haven\'t tested any clinical outcomes, and we haven\'t yet tested the duration and number of events, we have deemed the use of high-dose mesh radiation to be a success.""\nSince the study is still underway, a new way to reduce the use of mesh is also making a big difference.\nEven though its effectiveness decreases in the long term, the options are dwindling.\n""Some patients cannot even get out of their rooms because of the device,"" Bhagat said. ""In many patients, the option is to keep in touch with their spouse and have a romantic night.""\n""But this device does not look kindly on some of the people in the long term and helps them stay on treatment,"" she added.\nIn the future, though, the surgical option could become more available for patients at the time of procedure.\nBhagat plans to present a trial next year looking at the use of high-dose mesh radiation.\nAnd even though the use of high-dose mesh radiation has surged in the U.S., there\'s no universal standard. In fact, it\'s still seen as impossibly expensive, and even $300,000 or $400,000 is too much to treat.\n""A large trial is needed, because it takes time and it\'s expensive,"" Bhagat said. ""But we definitely do think that the best way to treat your patients is to use a standard treatment.""\n']"
119,A letter from a Michigan hospital system details who would get life-saving resources if equipment is short during the coronavirus pandemic,"[""The Flint hospital system is testing its public-private partnership with Roche, the Swiss healthcare giant, to make sure its new vaccines actually help keep the pandemic outbreak under control.\nThe CDC and Australian government launched a partnership late last year to help make sure doctors and nurses in the hospital system could use lethal medication before outbreaks of the virus, known as coronavirus (virus), can take hold in what have been seen to be potentially huge numbers of people who have been infected with the virus.\nAn example of what the partnership would look like is of biosecurity facility near Michigan in a sweltering, industrial-strength situation.\nPreliminary information, as well as others on the medical devices company’s board, has provided detailed information about the building’s existing “Phase Two Program” — in which another huge, redundant facility was built across the street. This time, the CDC’s planning department is looking to put its systems in place before the virus can reach the public, the letter by Michigan State University professor Scott Mason, published in The Washington Post, said.\nHe said the new thinking was designed to minimize the “natural surface area,” which suggests that the new building could double as a “functional platform” to be used for years to come. The facilities are set up to serve emergency operations, including hospitals, emergency departments, and refills, according to the letter.\nPreliminary company-leased data already shows that the hospital system’s two scanners — one having been decommissioned, another five years ago — are compatible with Roche’s science and technology, Mason said.\nHowever, the problems faced by medical devices are still well known in the medical care industry, he said. That’s because the main reason for the tainted terminal devices was that they already hold all relevant scientific and clinical information to verify those or any future biosecurity plans, he said.\nMason’s comment on how the company plans to apply for grants to upgrade the existing systems is largely unofficial, and uses a well-established practice in the industry to quote a Roche spokesman, who said this to The Post: “We are trying to improve the whole electronic risk management and we like to see that we reach out and help the community.”\nBut from a safety perspective, hospital systems are not a bad choice for the partnership.\nBy point of collapse, the patient would become the first in a long line of people who would have to be given such valuable hand-washing aid if the virus were to spread. The longer the disease is suppressed, the more likely the case would be for a pandemic, Mason explained.\nMason’s favorite scenario could happen where people learn, say, that their placenta had been contaminated and develop a history of symptoms or vaccines. Such a scenario, which would certainly work against the sickening cancerous cells in the placenta, would be “really scary,” he said.\nBut there’s an easy way out: the hospital’s stations can help those who could get affected, he added. Even research before the attacks of the 1993 World Trade Center in downtown Manhattan was factored into the initial US public health surveillance plan at the time. And to the extent that measures like these help protect people’s lives, it could also serve as a therapeutic tool, Mason said.\nStill, the most effective way to overcome the problems facing hospitals could be to deal with vaccine shortage, Mason said. Getting approved by federal or state health departments and testing is an investment for hospitals, according to Taylor Leppeth, a professor at Michigan State University’s Institute for Healthcare Leadership and management, and part of the faculty of the university’s Integrated Healthcare Institute.\n“It’s one of those things that you just go, ‘I’m crazy because this is happening today,'” Leppeth said. “There’s a lot of drug abuse, a lot of chemical-induced disruptions, and there’s a lot of adverse effects and some less-than-immediate risk to people.”\n– Jeffrey Ciullo can be reached at icullo@newstoday.com.\nYou can follow him on Twitter: @NYLegalNews.\n""]"

They come from Senegal and Guinea as well as Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone.\nIn 2015, 764 people were reported in West Africa, of which 156 were from Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone.\nBolivia, neighbouring West Africa, is experiencing the most significant coronavirus outbreak, with 27 reported deaths and 147 people suspected to have died.

124,"How to strengthen your immunity during the coronavirus pandemic: Exercise, meditation, sleep and stress management","['Intraving self-awareness in developing immunity, a new study suggests that people who get anxiety-inducing sleep patterns throughout the day may be a greater than usual target for the coronavirus virus. In one very disturbing study, the researchers focused on people who were patients of the worst flu pandemic in the last 15 years and experienced a very similar level of anxiety. The researchers found that patients with the strongest anxiety behavior weren’t as affected. Plus, anxiety patients had lower levels of folate, stress hormone and ovarian and thyroid hormone levels than healthy patients without the viruses.\nBut the study no longer explained why people were anxious when they were in isolation. Research published in the April 1 issue of Journal of Internal Medicine does.\nWhy doctors care about anxiety\n“When we are in crisis, our knowledge of the consequences of symptoms is limited. If we take much time and attention, we can start hearing about the root causes of anxiety, and then get less attention,” explains lead author Dr. Miranda Rosetri, a resident in the school of public health at Princeton.\nThe new study shows that hyperactive patients may become a target for the coronavirus virus and thus be more susceptible to the disease. The researchers think hyperactive individuals become more vulnerable to the virus through maintaining high levels of stress, and they found that more likely they were “likelier to be anxious in the absence of illness, whereas the majority of people with patients suffering from severe symptoms in the absence of illness typically respond with low levels of anxiety and low levels of non-incompetent care.”\nMedical: What we know now\nResearchers reviewed 271 patients at New York-Presbyterian Hospital / New York University–Rt. Hales–Greene, N.J., a private, full-service inpatient hospital and a co-write-off facility for the prevention and management of HCN. The researchers found that patients who suffered from chronic conditions — such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or asthma — experienced significant increased anxiety levels during their 35 hours of being cared for. These patients had higher levels of their immune response.\n“We felt they had, if you want to classify individuals, certain health disorders,” says Rosetri. “Sometimes, if you want to categorize people, you have to classify them more narrowly. And that is really where this is coming from.”\nWhen doctors really count how many times a patient with PTSD has been hospitalized and how long it takes for the underlying virus to arrive at his or her home, they get to know whether or not the patient has what the study describes as a high level of anxiety in the absence of symptoms.\nA better way to do this?\nRosetri and her colleagues call this an anti-incompetence technique. A combination of cognitive and emotional exercises — both of which are core to an anti-incompetence concept — can act as a “wake-up call.” The first step to re-exerting oneself to cope with the impending crisis is to reduce the amount of time that other people spend in their own homes. For these patients, they have the ability to “take on the responsibility” of managing the situation before it gets worse, such as maintaining a home office. For everyone, working toward recovery and healing can prove challenging.\nClick for more from USA Today\nBy Megan Friesen, USA Today\n']"

His partner, Scott Hunt, is scheduled to return home with emergency supplies to the family.\n“I think they’re making the best use of what he’s learning and trying to use it to help,” Commissioner Jeff Horn said of Anthony.\n“This has been a really big lesson to the medical community that you have to be mindful not to be too alert and you have to follow the sign,” Commissioner Steve Katz said.\nICE arrest last year found 49 people who were put on the county’s anti-cruelty registry. Those people were described as “state criminals,” or who had committed serious, personal or petty offenses, such as drug possession or prostitution, or engaged in bank robberies or similar crimes.\nBut just because ICE arrests are growing on the mainland doesn’t mean that OC faces severe problems with complacency, said Jessie Beatty, government relations manager at the Department of Homeland Security.\nICE detention of people awaiting trial without a trial is not uncommon, and during the past 10 years, the number of people designated as “prosecutors” doubled, to 310 detainees, over four years. Only about one percent of trials are made in the U.S., only a third for ICE and just 18 percent for prosecutors, Beatty said.\nIn 2017, ICE detained 144 people — all but five percent — for not having been convicted of a crime, according to a 2017 Homeland Security Department report.\nICE arrested more than 800 juveniles in the past 10 years, through Dec. 31, 2016. That number jumped to 305 last year.\nHorn said he won’t be surprised if more people fear arrest without an arrest.\n“It’s certainly our hope that people don’t start walking those streets on their own and assuming that they can be a visible example,” Horn said.\nThose agents can “keep everyone under wraps” when it comes to apprehension and detention of people who may commit crimes, he said.\n“The good news is it just seems like the public is open to it,” he said.\nAnthony Symons said he hopes he can persuade the ICE officials to order more police officers to be trained in the ambulance service.\n“I think this is going to be a resource,” Symons said. “We have to make sure that we equip our medical providers and bring the greatest benefit to them, not only to the patients but to the nation as a whole.”\n']"
126,Take a breath: How the simple act of meditative breathing helps us cope,"['Two days ago, I took a few breaths of yoga and I found myself having good days, but it was blissful. No pain in the stomach, no tired, fussing, or panic about anything that’s going to make me do yoga. Of course, I didn’t have to worry about the thought that I would be braindead again if it made me feel so awful and so withdrawn. The first time I inhaled a little and felt not desperate for a moment. It was obvious I was healthier than I thought. I couldn’t imagine a situation that was worse. As the next day went by, I had a quality I hadn’t learned to try to avoid.\nWhat does meditative breathing mean to you?\nYoga has been shown to help us deal with those thoughts and fears we have around us, which might seem trivial to many people, but in practice it can help us build resilience and even a sense of discipline. It can be shown to improve resilience, help us manage fatigue, and lift our body, too. It also strengthens our head and helps in managing stress. Because this technique is known as ""the puddle of freedom"", it is used to help you breathe out or increase your concentration. Intense breathing can prevent you from feeling energised and empty. Another powerful application of meditation to dealing with things is meditation. You can be meditating for the first time a week or three days prior to running off to the hospital. It can also help you regulate your breathing and energy levels for a longer period. Meditation is widely associated with rejuvenation, productivity, and cognitive well-being. Because this practice is based on an individual\'s perception of themselves as individuals, it can also boost our attention, co-efficient processes, and concentration. It\'s also effective in the prevention of depression, according to reports.\nHow do meditative breathing help you cope?\nTaken together, the three pillars of meditative breathing that meditative breathing offers, stand out from the rest of the visual and auditory disruption. The three pillars are ""the breathing of freedom"", ""the breathing of the finality"", and ""the breathing of co-production"". Four key steps of meditative breathing are to practise:\nAim for high breathing at the first three or four meditation levels that help you to feel part of the world.\nListen to ""voice"" of the healing and meditation guided breathing.\nHold out the breath for six minutes, flutter your shoulders and let this mindfulness talk in your head. You can bring your heart rate up to 100 or 240. It will help you breathe in and will help you feel relaxed and in control. Breathe in the space at the top of your lungs, and to the body. This means you should hear ""ise"" and ""rehearsal"" and ""mingle"" with your brain\'s natural language processing and communication.\nIt\'s important to understand that the puddle of freedom or tiredness is physiological, not psychological. In our brains we have a duty to transmit the flow of blood to our bodies, and the puddle of freedom means we are constantly dealing with the flow. It\'s essential to be meditative to ensure all my life is being sustained and efficiently absorbed. However, meditative breathing is not all about avoiding pain or a worry. It can also help you relax, to help you also adjust, to the reality that everything is good, and to manage the overwhelming feeling of not having satisfied yourself. Of course there are many factors, but it’s essential to remember that life is full of adventure, continuous improvements and the arrival of our own wellbeing. If you have something to think about, or might have something to feel better about, you might be surprised to learn that a day at the doctor’s office gives you the chance to consider the joy of being grateful, and yet feeling hopeful about what\'s ahead.\n']"
127,Do you wear contact lenses? You should switch to glasses to stop spreading the virus,"['Share\nIt’s safe to say you don’t want to think about wearing contact lenses. Is it safe to make eye contact on the flip of a switch? You’re about to see what little optician they actually can tell you. The opthalmological detectory information can detect symptoms of the fatal fibrous lining disorder (Fosploid). According to some reports, the disease is usually caused by the infection of the lens itself. In China, you can also infect someone with Fosploid, which is like a viral infection. Sometimes, you’ll just have to walk away and avoid contact lenses altogether.\nIn the US, you have to stop using contact lenses and optometry and optogenetics altogether. The CDC says this is already an issue with health care workers and those who wear contact lenses.\nIn 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised people to stop using contact lenses and optometry altogether — a decision that is discussed in many ways in the fight against Fosploid. Current advice for this sort of thing comes from Harvard Medical School. However, after the CDC suggested people should stop using contact lenses and optometry altogether, there is a secondary issue, according to the magazine The New York Times. This potential connection to your eyes may be the primary factor in the deterioration of the retina, or the way your eyes work.\n“We still have a lot of disagreement on this one,” Freda Bonnor, assistant professor of ophthalmology at the University of Pennsylvania, told the New York Times. “There’s also this debate about the potential potential cure of Fosploid.” This debate involves the complex relationship between the ion channels that make it easier for the lens to approach. The ion channels redirect the vessel of space between the lens and the optic nerve. It could also result in more poor eye vision.\nIf you’re planning to use contact lenses this summer, we’re guessing that most people will be skimming the lens with about two seconds of your being the recipient of the virus. Do you ever use a contact lens, especially optical binoculars, that you wouldn’t mind then running some blood tests. You can even use your eyes, which naturally make eye contact easier, to induce a gizmo that detects the disease.\nAccording to a recent study, the first time you noticed a mutation in your eye, it was no effect on your left eye. However, to assume that your left eye is the cause of the incisors, scientists have seen a same effect in the eyes of both children and adults. This means that children with Fosploid may have more problems with their eye not being able to focus on one eye.\nWant to know what other health claims your eyes might be capable of combating? Well, nothing can stop you from wearing contact lenses and optometry.\n']"
128,Inspirational quotes to get us through the coronavirus shutdown,"['Honors: James Stanley shared his reflections on getting through the coronavirus shutdown. Photograph: James Stanley\nRoll the dial down to several: ""Reasons others have ignored, but given that we did not see this happen: \'When someone can kill all modern men without taking care of their own health, why not?\', the future becomes a ""speed-dating mission to find a cure or a human gene"".\nThese were a great quotes on many topics, all of which are important, those who value personal comfort and inspiration.\nAs a man of honour, an inspiring quote was taken from my conversation with 17-year-old Jonathan Franzen. He spoke to my admiration in that he had thought of maybe burying a wellwisher and seeing the sun… but I thought that one the doctor read out had been the wife’s. She was the only one in the room.\nHonours: Martin Garnry shared what experiences he had, but wanted not to think or feel. For this he was a doctor. Dr Garnry was one of the people who discovered the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and became the first person in history to treat it. He decided to provide a course for Nigerians in a time of emergency for a blind man, a change of scenery for them to look after their well-being. There was some fine literature that had prepared us all.\nCourage: We can be fearless and equally with the sciences. In recent days, we have seen the likes of Sir Donald Robinson, the former prime minister, Sir Bisharat Guwahati, former Chinese president Deng Xiaoping, Nobel Peace Laureate Chen Shulin, Nobel Prize-winning Australian director Harold Camping and the Nobel Prize-winning New Zealander. There have also been prominent members of the top international drug science organisations, not for the least bit scared of being stigmatised, confused and perhaps traumatised by these experiences. Courage, nevertheless, all too often faces the indignity of being judged and vilified when one truly gets what you want to get done. I try to find other examples where it is necessary to get through the blockade.\nHelping People\nAccording to the 2015 WHO national report, 1.2 million children worldwide die before they reach the age of 4 and 1.2 million are missing from their lives due to illness, injury or disease. Of these 2.8 million, approximately 1.8 million children are affected by illness and close to 5 million suffer from childhood illnesses.\nWhat can we do? We can increase awareness of the health threat, find effective ways to prevent illness and save money, reduce those at risk of illness and save lives. If we did this, we could end the pandemic-like carnage that destroys millions of lives worldwide. Our children could have, if not for a few simple things we could do at our doorsteps, across the world.\nIt is also important that we do not forget the experiences of people around the world, too often these people just die. The consequences of being sick can be so devastating to a human being that they are the mechanisms for social breakdown, disease and poverty, so when we talk about making our health a priority, we are more apt to give human beings easy access to pharmaceuticals to sell to our soft drink industries. We all have common illnesses and disease that need treatment and we are more reluctant to have a simple cure for them.\nWhen you stop to think about it, we know that when you are sick, that whole system is changed. It is no longer just about the survival of a person, it is about making an immediate difference to the way their health is being handled around the world, so we can help to spread good health throughout the world.\nWe need to send education and awareness of the ""three-way right path"" for future diseases that can easily spread to others and that profit from lifestyles of the adults – not just the poorest in society.\nSo some great quotes, some inspirational quotes, some timeless advice for you. We want to share one from our blog that, from the National Office of National Statistics, will help us to have a clearer picture of your wellbeing.\nThis article first appeared in the Guardian published on the fifth anniversary of the World Health Assembly.

(Stanley Blackmun/Associated Press)\nUS coronavirus cases top 137,000 as Trump extends social distancing guidelines until April 30\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Violent responses to Donald Trump\'s platform to end social media restrictions have been the most deadly global vaccine-preventable illness since 1972, according to new federal data released Tuesday.\nThe cases recorded in parts of Asia last year for the state of Alaska and South Korea rank second-highest behind the United States, with 234 deaths and 76 people dying. The number of patients who died either online or by dialing dialysis treatment decreased, both by two-thirds to about 2,000.\nThat may come as a relief to the Trump administration, which has been accused of obscuring the issue from the public\'s view. Washington state authorities are looking into an increase in the number of infections linked to the conservative Trump campaign and the Michigan Primary Care Coalition\'s plans to label Idaho the first ""public health emergency.""\nThe data shows that the U.S. infant mortality rate fell to 10.5 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2016, and slightly more fatal cases of measles, mumps and rubella disappeared following the start of Trump\'s first campaign.\nStill, the numbers cited are somewhat larger than those for measles and thalassemia outbreaks.\n""Ongoing concern that the Trump administration is closing out social media guidelines can\'t be ignored by policymakers or well-meaning citizens,"" said Dr. Maureen Bucknell, director of infectious disease research at the St. Louis-based John Hopkins Health System, in the report.\nOn the sidelines of the global vaccine health conference this week, Republican legislators sought to provide reassurance about the Trump administration\'s outreach efforts. Trump responded by demanding that the administration call out people with National Public Radio\'s coverage of hospital and clinic snags.\nAs expected, some constituents delayed calling the White House.\nPaul Price, director of public affairs for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, blamed the cuts, but the CDC also noted that some recent air pollution screenings had dampened access to American health care and provided low-priority patients with generic treatments.\nThe rise in the fatal cases, the CDC said, more than doubled the number of participants receiving care across the globe since 2016.\nA series of outbreaks ""were a swift response to a timely public health emergency that exacerbated the devastating consequences of a global epidemic that continued to increase"" since September, the CDC said.\nThe rate of immunity recovery has been cut about half since July, then flat in March after more than 90 cases reported each day.\nIn September, several thousand patients were offered and treated in New York and two deaths were confirmed. In Michigan, more than 63 people have died.\nTrump had barred newspapers and radio and television stations from using smartphones or computers to collect high-resolution personal data on users, and also denied the public access to last year\'s Health Day celebrations hosted by the Trump Organization.\n']"
130,New York state overrules a hospital policy saying mothers must give birth without their partners,"['New York State began reimposing a state law barring health care providers from having children with same-sex partners when New York legalized birth control earlier this year.\n""Because women need a woman as their partner in order to ensure a child\'s future health care policy is in alignment with medical practice, New York State requires that women take a pregnancy test to determine if their non-contraceptive contraceptive methods are effective, and what are the results,"" state Senate Republican Leader Loretta Weinberg said in a statement.\nThe bill, the first of its kind passed in the Statehouse, was written after a court ruled last month that allowing one partner to have multiple family members is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court affirmed its ruling in June.\nWomen have long complained about being barred from having children with same-sex partners, although the law allows people with other options to provide coverage for those available to them. It comes at a time when the state is looking to expand access to the contraceptive options, and getting such options may be tough. The state\'s child-rearing commission gave the board the authority to move forward with implementing the state\'s policy.\nThe bill also lifted the ban on child-rearing programs like preventative care. It also exempted family-planning assistance, and in a revised version, it allowed businesses to set up a plan for contracting with couples instead of all traditional clinics.\nNew York was the first state in the nation to offer birth control coverage to people with opposite-sex partners, so it comes at a time when most women rely on receiving a fertility treatment by partner to ensure the delivery can happen in their lifetime. It came after the Supreme Court issued a temporary stay of the nation\'s highest court in January ruling on the issue.\n""The Supreme Court upholds the traditional family plan rule in a major way,"" said Schneiderman. ""Therefore, we should not be dismantling the traditional family plan rule.""\nThe state legislation was designed to ease in-state discrimination of families, but New York state lawmakers ruled that the law was inconsistent with one of New York\'s two state laws, which allow parents to choose whether to have a child outside of one\'s pre-existing sexual relationship. That provision gave birth-control clinics a way to introduce services that will allow them to serve New York City residents with identical health conditions.\nSeveral medical groups, including Planned Parenthood and the LIRR, who have argued that the state\'s redefinition of ""ideal"" is harmful to both women and their children, said the ruling was expected to further moderate the course of the proposed statute, which would enable some clinics to offer contraceptive care that is cheaper than the services provided by traditional clinics.\n""Today\'s ruling means even more women will no longer be able to have children without their partner\'s consent,"" said Sarah Krantz, director of policy and public policy at the Center for Reproductive Rights. ""This harms all people by allowing women to not only face long odds but more importantly life-threatening disease.""\nThe Catholic Diocese of Manhattan, which has about 1,200 Catholic dioceses in the Bronx and surrounding areas, said it was upset and surprised to learn the state is reimposing the statute, adding that it had been working with other dioceses to devise a way to manage the effects of the statute.\n""When this simple rule was announced, the traditional family plan rule was immediately slammed in the press and, more specifically, in our parish and diocesan parishes,"" said the diocese in a statement. ""In doing so, the district court dismissed a wide range of lawsuits and denounced one of the most egregious distortions of this statewide statute.\n""This bill has passed the state Senate, but New York\'s constitution requires that this bill be passed in the state House and passed through the state House without any changes to the law.""\nMany health organizations have argued that the statute is redundant and contrary to New York\'s law, and will have great adverse impacts on the wellness of children who want to be tested for at least one of two early signs of pre-surgical birth.\n""New York will lose money over the long term by allowing for government-mandated birth control coverage under a current law that is unconstitutionally vague and unduly restrictive,"" wrote the New York Hospital Association, one of the health care organizations filing a lawsuit against the legislature, in a statement to The Times.\nIt\'s unclear when the law would take effect.\n']"

It was not as simple as letting everyone live in that state to a certain degree, and not knowing what could happen next if an infection was detected,"" Wales said.\n""It\'s a beautiful disease to have and it\'s turned on its head. It\'s crazy what it has taken, but if the cells die out that could lead to paralysis. Now we can turn that away,"" Wales said.\nCicely himself had a story to tell. He went to prison for abusing at least seven women who were supposed to have been visitors at his home. His jail sentence was reduced to 25 years in prison.\nAt that time, when the man was 17 years old, police said he took heroin, two of which were still used when he was 27 years old.\nEarlier this year, Cicely admitted he took heroin because he wanted to have a year of cocaine, but when they checked into a drug rehab facility, doctors discovered marijuana use was making him sick.\nOn Monday, thousands attended his funeral.\nDonates:\nThe Caldwell Fine Arts Center, 1290 Town Center Drive, Roland 1\nAffiliated hardware\nCopa Blast\n70113-30075\nFurniture Show Booth\n100 Jefferson\nGeorgetown\n11290 South Charles Street\nLouisiana\n33 years old\nSaved for Life\nLIFE STAKES:\n$1,200,000,000\n$50,000,000,000\nProducts available\nOrganic Cherry, Cinnabon orange, Garden and Garden Lemonade\nE-Commerce\n']"
132,The US keeps millions of chickens in secret farms to make flu vaccines. But their eggs won't work for coronavirus,"['The U.S. government stopped buying and distributing chickens based on what scientists are calling “social tests” at a U.S. farm to obtain accurate birds’ eggs, U.S. poultry experts said Wednesday.\nThe government last year had to halt buying, distributing and keeping chickens for the government as part of efforts to win legal protection for them and bring them to a common supply for public consumption.\nThe chickens, whose eggs are sold on imported food processors, will remain in a farm off of the Tennessee-Tennessee line. But their eggs won’t work for coronavirus vaccine that is needed to treat the virus, according to Dr. Will Fried, chief of the American Board of Biologics at the National Institutes of Health, which oversees the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nBecause the eggs won’t work, doctors likely will use techniques pioneered by groups working for top secret vaccines that can use animal immune and other tissue to make them fail. Their patients may suffer serious complications if their eggs aren’t used, the scientists said.\n“This is an egregious violation of the federal … DNA requirements,” Fried said Wednesday at a meeting of IBC, the annual meeting of small scientific firms in London. “They do all this to manipulate you for your marketing purposes.”\nThe experiments, carried out by Translational Medicine International at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, came to light only recently after the Agriculture Department’s “DNA Diagnostics Partnership” began presenting more recent research results showing laboratory testing at this facility correctly identified two volunteers who had no immune disease.\nA final delay in purchasing tests must now be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, which in recent years has issued tighter regulations on vaccine use for people who have human dengue fever. The FDA said a delay could delay an already hastily underway nationwide new vaccine-preventing program to follow up on tuberculosis cases.\nA 2014 ""White House Initiative on Vaccines and Immunization of Young People with a Blood Disease"" funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture set up a listening council, which was chaired by Dr. Peter Lightman of Harvard University and under U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue.\nScientists and vaccine makers say the methods are evidence that they are science-based, but the people who had the attention were turned over by Progeny Plus LLC, a trade group with a database of customers.\nOther countries were discussing more, such as Brazil, which has a program called Project Plan, an open-market vaccination program overseen by the USDA. India is pushing to create its own free, food-marketed exchange for vaccine makers who are selling directly to consumers.\nSince the project began, the U.S. has got involved in CVD research. Others, including Pfizer Inc. and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have studied the H1N1 virus as a possible cause for the deadly flu pandemic. The U.S. doesn’t even collect animal egg egg numbers, a process that already was being done there.\nThe program is designed to stop the New Zealand coronavirus at its source in the country, rather than keep them in Canada. France and Turkey have offered to install electronic buying lists along the border, along with an exchange system to exchange samples between those nations.\nIn the meantime, phone and e-mail announcements from the health department have focused on clamping down on the practices at slaughterhouses. The network of pork-focused dealers, which officials now need to track, sells eggs to a small nationwide chain, but e-mails and calls still rely on house calls, the producers said.\nThe Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Biologics has said it wants to “use small steps” to win consumers’ approval for products using the same methods that have long been the source of many flu vaccine concerns.\nThe benefits, said Fried, were noticeable last year to some consumers, because many of them believed the same method was effective at reducing the number of deaths from the flu.\nNew Zealand scientists, however, say those findings have vanished, and it’s likely that them will have to do extensive testing at a farm in South Yorkshire, England, to ensure they comply with current tests.\n']"

More to come.\n“The number one disease we’ve ever encountered is a virus that has been linked to several large outbreaks in India and all over the world, so we are determined to safeguard the public health,” Kumar said.\nFlorence started a spreading spread in April and spread into the central Indian city of Mumbai this past week. Manisha Kaur, who wrote an article titled “Viral Fever: Did Cough Drugs Cause a Decline?” sent her son a letter, April 5, criticizing the city’s emergency response efforts at the very time that Nadiya Raja, a 19-year-old student who brought the bacteria to Mumbai from California, had caused a decline in her chance of meeting her own mortality.\nFlorence spread to Gujarat, Calcutta, Haryana, Bihar, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, and Uttar Pradesh before hitting Madrid last month. Other parts of the outbreak have spread over two days.\nA sequence published in the journal Science last month showed one viral pathogen was blamed for 13 deaths last week in California, according to officials, and three deaths in Italy have been linked to the outbreak.\nThe outbreak was most pronounced in New Delhi, where the deadliest was the epicenter of the outbreak, caused by salt water running from dust from Hindu temples that burst into the city.\n“The incidence of pneumococcal infection among young patients with pneumonia is well below that of pregnant women and amongst teenagers. Our preventive work is paying off,” said Kumar.\nCritics on both sides of the debate have pointed to the country’s 1999 health service reform act, when it enacted the purchase of family planning insurance. But Kumar expressed concern about the real-life implications of “going rogue” and demanding that the Government do something about the agency that created the epidemic.\n“For the United States, the most responsible approach is by setting up a private health insurer, just like the Medicare Part D offer,” he said.\n“There needs to be steps that are taken by the government to enforce this standard,” he said.\nMeanwhile, a group of researchers suing for potential profit by Canada’s environmental cleanup agency over its failure to blame employees who were responsible for spread of the deadly bacteria say they are putting their research into public service.\n“The sanctity of the Statecraft office hasn’t even ended,” said the Transamerica Tri-States Oil and Gas Research Institute, a decision-making institute of Washington state. “What the National Institutes of Health is doing is funding climate change experiments.”\n- This story has been updated to include an additional list of people from the Cetacean Research Institute who are seeking income as medical researchers and bio-medical investigators.\n']"

Of those, 52,000 are not so new names who were born in the United States or have had permanent resident status since 2006.\nTrump also extended immigration guidelines he issued on Friday.\nFor individuals with a false signature, the threshold for deportation can be raised by a few hundred dollars to deter undocumented immigrants from seeking legal status.\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that the principle on immigration under President Barack Obama was that only people of lawful permanent resident status, illegal aliens who had been deported have been thrown out, in particular, those with green cards.\n“It is important to note that when an illegal alien here is on immigration, he or she still has a legal status as a legal permanent resident,” Sanders said on Saturday. “The administration is particularly concerned that a third of the country that is in immigration control can’t prove that they’re still here. The administration is working with Congress to address the issue.”\nIn order to make their case, immigration advocates have focused on two issues: the possibility that immigrants like Panah and Cabrera are completely shielded from deportation by their respective legal status.\nPanah is an illegal alien living illegally in the U.S. without legal status, while Cabrera is an immigrant from Honduras. Additionally, both have not been aware of their extended family status.\n“This isn’t just Latinos, it’s the children as well. These children know what they’re doing. They love this country. They’re taking the care that our mother and father gave them,” said Gonzalez to C-SPAN last week.\n“The government looks at them and they’re not, at least in our society, as criminals. So they have no, no moral compass,” added Oropeza to CPAs.\nOropeza contends that Trump has erred by the decision to extend the citizenship applications that were issued to the more than 135,000 applicants.\n“President Trump issued these applications because of the immigration issue that remains for the most part. It’s because of our immigration system. I ask what’s wrong with this decision? He has arbitrarily extended citizenship … he’s backed into dangerous territory. It’s an absurd situation.”\nFollow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

It’s an unfortunate decision to deporting ‘better educated’ citizens and avoid immigration re-evaluation,” said Kelli Gilbert, a spokesperson for Sanctuary USA, another nonprofit advocacy group founded by former House speaker Newt Gingrich.\n“The goal is to prevent and mitigate illegal immigration,” wrote Gilbert to The Guardian. “This could mean shifting the expectation that only legal immigrants are removed and that everyone is automatically going to be covered by the same administration.”\n']"

140,Egypt’s Female Lion Tamers Show the Men How to Do It,"['Guns n’ Roses fans don’t want a historic era repeating: with the introduction of a new female Ali Larrabee named Tamir, the posse of 85 Egyptian female female lionesses — called Tiger Lilys, also known as Houthods — is today remembered as a woman before it was even a male guard of Arab culture. Tamir was the first female lion to be created in Egypt; the country was ravaged by an Arab-Muslim civil war that until the beginning of the conflict resulted in total destruction. The reason Tamir chose to make it her own and work as a lioness is due to her pure intelligence, which she explains is also attributed to her breeding experiences and genes. So while an expected African lion does not name away, Tamir was trained in self-loathing, discipline, deception, power and vulnerability during her life to overcome her challenges and become a lioness herself. Her life lessons followed her profession, research, trading, breeding, and horses. Today, women do not need to worry what Tamir might not have been prepared for: the first female lion, in Egypt’s history, was killed by tigers in the park of Alkarim, 600 kilometers from the capital of Cairo. Women also need to be taught how to make animals respond to emotion in a real-life situation. At Ali’s Dar Hames Academy for Sciences, she wanted women to learn how to use her intelligence to learn how to stick it to the lions, who faced a man right in the centre of their training. The students have begun to pay their own way through life in the academy. The students’ verbal, physical, moral and moral indoctrination also comes through their high school performance. Compared to their counterparts in other subjects, physical education, in sports and academics, is not a significant hurdle. Many practicing sports are a well-coordinated activity.\nIt is because of this that male lions with the males are expected to play alongside the females. The females are then subject to training to solve their problems, which is is also what females are taught in Dar Hames, which is the simplest of all exercises to become lionesses. Tamir was eager to get on to the race ahead of him, so she starts training with the males in a more controlled environment. The lionesses are usually present in one of the pools at a pool. What is worse is that, unlike in other basic exercises taught by the lionesses, Tamir only repeats exercises that occur before, during, and after the battle of Alkarim. When she is not working with the lions, Tamir and the males are always teaching Tamir a different alphabet. The result is equal coherence and equal functioning: within the gap of the tigers in the woods, the lions learn the original names of food. During training, it is possible to learn eight alphabets and two letters, because when the tigers are trained, the master hands the lions an A, B, C, D and K and while on the A, the master hands the tigers an E. It is the latest reinforcement of Tamir’s principles and techniques.\nThanks to Tamir, all humans (other than lions) are more alive than they look. It is that elfin immortality that makes tigers our choices from here. The best part about the care Tamir gave for her mentees is that he did not share those qualities. Tamir, with his persistence, allowed them to make the tough decisions they must to survive an artificial life.\n']"

Model, Refugee.","['Musician David Welsh has performed well outside the US, earning a BSA Fellowship, a long-term MBNA profile, a handsome $400,000 on a US Open of Arts scholarship, and several other awards. With an unusual mix of US and European-based love of music and an international penchant for global music, he has performed at the US, Europe, Australia, Canada, and South America since 2015.\nOn top of that, Welsh created instruments, which allowed his manger to play the classic instrument of a who’s who of concerts—Comedian Tom Daley, Deadmau5, Weird Al Yankovic, Brendan Smith, Mark Morris, Stipe Pimentel, Paul Williams, John Hargreaves, and the Jimi Hendrix tribute band.\nIn many ways, Wales’ work has been the collective work of his eclectic compatriots. He has showcased the creation of instruments like the strings—the Brahms, Beethoven, Mozart, et al—in love songs and songs like “Sixteen Allon”. And then there’s his show, the “Woman Matters in Concert” that took place at Newark’s Saturn Theatre at the end of December.\nHow did this show rank, you ask? Well, its rock performance speaks to its lineage. For this show, Welsh has played with original compositions by Franz Liszt, Thom Yorke, Derek Trucks, and Peter Gabriel. He has made a run at collaborating with Elliott Smith, the British John Coltrane, Rufus Wainwright, and John Hoy, among many others. It is on course to be Welsh’s most prolific show to date.\nIt’s a show that fits perfectly with the American aesthetic of musical theatre. In fact, when you look at it you can see why. Welsh’s products are self-explanatory, but they feature impeccable black and white, black and white. Their beauty is rooted in the deep inspirations for the Western and Eastern soul music of the 1920s and the gritty, gritty music of the ’70s and ’80s. This is sound that is one of the parts of his book that he quotes. “I think humanity is seeing us rather more consciously than us seeing ourselves but we know that ourselves.”\nIt’s a meditation on both loneliness and isolation that shares some of the same origins. “‘There are two different world, why not together’ is the center point of this piece.”\nThat is why he works at the Grateful Dead, but he did not sing at the show. He said the album also fills a part of his body because of the unrehearsed nature of his performances. “You can see the shock. There’s just a trip you have to get yourself into that stage.”\nIt is the repetition of this history that makes this tune “The Big Show,” with an expressiveness that is a miracle. You can hear Welsh through the shirt they provided for him; there is nothing like that.\n']"
142,North Korea Launches Two Short-Range Ballistic Missiles,"['A Korean War veteran walks by the bomb site of an offshore missile launch.\nPhoto by Lars A. Goran/AP\nNorth Korea has launched two new short-range ballistic missiles - one with a long-range range and the other with an intermediate range - in what appears to be an effort to show off its latest technologies, the country’s Korean Central News Agency said in a report Saturday.\nSouth Korea’s national security office said the launches, carried out by the South Korean island of Hwangju, came earlier in the day after dozens of people died in weather events. The nation’s Army Chief warned that the launch would cause ""irreparable damage"" to the nation’s military and the survival of democracy in North Korea.\nNorth Korea also carried out another missile launch in the South on Thursday, according to Korea’s state-run Korean Central News Agency. The missiles were said to have a range of 2,300 kilometers (1,260 miles), while the South Korean agency said they were built at Seoul’s Busan campus.\nOn Monday, North Korea blasted off two medium-range ballistic missiles, which were later spotted by South Korea, according to state media. The missiles were believed to be brought to the peninsula from Malaysia.\nThe missiles are believed to be capable of reaching South Korea and possibly the US mainland, although Pyongyang says its missiles are not intended to strike the South.\nLast month, North Korea tested two short-range rockets that were believed to have the length of an atomic bomb in mid-April. The latest missiles appeared to come from a long-range missile that appears to have a shelf-life of around a week.\nNorth Korea routinely tests its missiles for long-range missiles, and nuclear weapons, as early as 2015. The weapons have been rapidly tested on a growing scale, but have not proved to be capable of carrying any long-range nuclear warheads.\nNorth Korea has long been suspected of pursuing ballistic missile technology, with officials saying the underground nuclear facilities were operated by its intercontinental ballistic missile program. Officials said the country believed it had developed three satellites, which may have been launched from the country\'s arid northeast.\nThe latest missile launch comes more than six months after North Korea unveiled a long-range rocket, carrying two designed for military use. On March 15, North Korea said the launch was intended to gather enough intelligence for a missile warhead to reach the US mainland, though Seoul\'s president, Moon Jae-in, said the test was not the result of a nuclear test.\nSouth Korea reported Tuesday that another missile in mockup has led to warnings from Russia and China that North Korea may be looking to develop nuclear weapons, unless it can get a response to a warhead that can pose a threat to the mainland.\nJapan and the United States have both warned of possible military action against the North, though Washington warned it could leave Japan at risk of losing its military if the North ramps up its missiles.\nIn Tokyo, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe indicated the country was willing to get used to dropping bombs on Pyongyang.\nAbe said the coming launch would bolster his efforts to return the region to peace. He said North Korea needs to know that it is not ""weak, cold or sated"". He said the reclusive North will always have the right to provocation and should abandon nuclear ambitions.\nMoon said his country ""has been forced to do everything within its power"" to stop Kim Jong Un\'s nuclear program, but added that North Korea should consider ""to ratchet up its defensive capabilities"".\n_____\nAP writers Lisa Marie Tran in Seoul, South Korea and Jerome Rubinstein in Washington contributed to this report.\n']"
143,"Russian State Oil Company Rosneft, in Sudden Move, Sells Assets in Venezuela","['The selling of assets is the latest effort by Russian state oil company Rosneft to cement its position in Venezuela, whose debt also boils to billions of dollars.\nThe price that Rosneft hopes to pay in Russian money down the line was on the mark Friday when it offered “quite a few” contracts to Royal Dutch Shell for $2.7 billion ($2.82 billion) and $4.75 billion from PDVSA for bonds issued to fund its recent $4.3 billion purchase of Caracas’s various oil assets, saying the $4.3 billion purchase came “represents a sum currently unknown”.\n“The sale reflects the demand for high-quality sukuk with a relatively strong pipeline backing [the purchase],” Rosneft’s head of corporate affairs, Alexander Loursin, told the Russian news agency TASS.\nRosneft and Shell have been widely seen as rivals in the tightly politicized oil sector, with a handful of companies unwilling to give up their hold on the rich Gulf state, where the former British colony has seen a decade of rising state involvement that has seen the strengthening of powerful political forces.\nBut while the pro-government opposition keeps stumbling, the fact that the combined companies were selling oil says it may be looking towards other bidding when competition for contracts on many of the world’s largest oil fields heats up after Petrobras announced a $19 billion state takeover of Venezuela.\nVenezuela’s recently-spurned $6.8 billion bid by Rosneft, a local firm, or the Socialist government of Vice President Nicolas Maduro, presents a serious challenge for some rivals and has drawn vociferous opposition protests from oil workers and independent political groups.\n“Rosneft needed to address this situation and was again successful,” Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Twitter. “I offer the proceeds of the sale.”\nRosneft pledged to carry out a more orderly process to sell Russian oil blocks in Venezuela if new investors, including multibillion-dollar oil firms such as Chevron Corp, ended their deal.\n“The sellers/reporters are being well thought out,” European oil analyst Theo Karlberger of Bernstein said. “They have to act differently than the current, more complex Venezuelan market.”\nIn the meantime, Putin is on Tuesday touring Venezuela, when he will take part in the G20 summit and also discuss the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ highly secretive package to curb output.\nOil markets have remained volatile through the April 30, when President Nicolas Maduro failed to negotiate an agreement to limit output. Shares in Rosneft fell 1.8 percent Friday, adding to losses in European shares.\nThe losses in Russian stocks also appear to signal that Russia is on the losing end of its efforts to sell Venezuela’s assets to boost its state oil market, which finances billions of dollars a year.\nRosneft and Venezuela’s oil regulator and PDVSA declined to comment to TASS, but said they were “monitoring” the situation, noting that Venezuela “has no binding obligations regarding US facilities”.\nGRAPHIC: Tragedy grips Venezuela as oil prices rise\nIf the sale of Rosneft’s Venezuelan assets was not enough to get approval from Venezuela’s government, Ukraine has so far failed to sell Venezuelan assets with Russia’s blessing.\nIn November, the state company was forced to release 2.2 billion dollars in bonds – notes that could fall to current market price – by trying to sell some but not all of them to PDVSA. Officials said those bonds could likely hold up against the devaluation.\nThat denied shares in Rosneft, which have risen 27 percent this year, even as the company said it no longer paid enough to secure the bonds that helped rescue the embattled economy.\nRussian officials have also been eyeing possible deals with Venezuela to buy up more Venezuelan assets such as state-controlled oil company PDVSA.\nThe sale of Rosneft’s Venezuelan assets last weekend sent its shares underperformed a few other asset-rich Gulf oil majors including BP and Shell.\n“You need a better deal than what Rosneft offered” if a Rosneft sale does go through, Yulia Susranga, a spokeswoman for Petromatrix Corp, a state-owned energy company, told Reuters in an email.\nPDVSA was due to face off with rival oil producer Cemex on Monday for the sale of Venezuela’s long-delayed oil reserves. Cemex declined to comment.\n']"

Another slew of gastroenteritis and viral infections is sweeping through the country, with more than 700,000 registered cases reported over the last few months alone. The enormous threat to the country’s health system comes from its vastly elevated risk of contracting hepatitis C and HIV.\nThe virus can be passed from mother to child, with the advent of IV watermelons and the consumption of camel milk, the “immortality” method for death. This increase in risk of infected people receiving antibiotics or so-called “not blood” treatment, sent some Chinese practitioners to suicide courses. Some cases are admitted to clinical care, however, and just one person is reported to have been hospitalized, according to online medical media.\nThis is happening for the same reason that infectious disease outbreaks from AIDS and typhoid sickened 1.4 million people as recently as 2011, just a few months before the outbreak. Fast forward a few years and cases have been flying around in China’s cities, with more than a million people dying last year from a serious problem. Even in the Trump era, health policies and regulatory structures play a vital role in bringing about the outbreak, as a number of medics reported.\nSo why are such numbers rising?\nOn a per capita basis, China’s youth population is twice the world average. The most recent data from September 2017, 2017, shows that 23% of the population are aged 18-24. This is an increase of 22% from 15% in 1990.

Without more specific lab exposure, it could mean less effective screening methods and more frequent exposure.\nInovirus kills in bulk. Due to the huge variety of infectious diseases on the planet, they are difficult to isolate — and the new Swiss study from Markel, the best source of first-hand historical data on the virus, says that the 2D isotope of Inovirus appears to be established, apart from a single third of humans, in a group of 14,684 people worldwide (including Americans).\nGood news for Europe: Health tests earlier this week revealed a significant decline in the number of people who could have been infected with the virus.\nAs for the United States, there have been fewer outbreaks since last summer — and we have had some big ones.\nThis article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

With the possible exception of vinegar, a lot of baby food, full ingredients for formula such as bread and milk, and baby formulas, the consumer doesn’t take food seriously in this way.\nThe time spent in the grocery store, the catering for meeting the caring needs of the household, and actually buying food without purchasing from shop staff means that many people have no idea about the source of this potentially infectious virus.\nThe worst-case scenario for potentially affected holidaymakers is that they’ll be traveling on unauthorized and dirty flights home, and consumers will find themselves in the hot seat of tour operators, at airports, and even in the stands of sporting events if they don’t proceed with proper planning and preparation.\nAccording to the BBC, around 5 million British lives have been lost to the disease since it began in the U.K. in 2016, and the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that up to 25,000 new cases may be identified each year.\nMeanwhile, a key to all outdoor living and safety is germs, a common nasty and flu-like illness associated with transportation. People are exposed to it by flying, going over small rainforest sites, driving with only a hand filter, bathing in pools of water, or even stealing food. While harmful exposure can be avoided with liquids and food safely washed, others should also take a close look at natural roots before adding something harmful.\nIce will be necessary to survive, so if your mother-in-law worries you about her due to jet lag, please give her a tissue so that she has at least three to five days to recover from the virus.\n']"
148,Pandemic Mars Putin’s Coronation and Endangers Russia’s Veterans,"['For far too long, the Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian Orthodox Union (SFU) have been second only to Orthodoxy in protests over the atrocities committed in Syria. In Syria the SFU is also the largest voice within the government of President Bashar al-Assad, who has been implicated in abuses that took place decades ago as well as Kofi Annan, who is acting head of UN peace-keeping forces. These conditions include the dramatic rise of ISIS, and deep interference in Russia’s ongoing domestic affairs.\nThen, this March, a similar configuration for protests erupted in the Basra region where Syrian refugees are barred from receiving protection from international NGOs and foreign media.\nIn October, a group of 1,000 leaders of the Basra Arab Social Forum (ENASF) published a document exposing a systematic oppression of Syrian Kurdish people living in Basra, especially for the Kurdish language, and the lack of economic security in towns and cities. In addition, the Haaretz newspaper reported on mass displacement and displacement camps in Iraq and the Arctic region—one of the Syrian villages, formerly the Diyarbakir Townhats. The meetings are reported as “dialogue” following a plan to expel one hundred and fifty thousand Syrian Kurds who live near Turkey, the main international transit point for refugees who can make it to Turkey after they arrive.\nAs I wrote in this space just a few weeks ago, the threats of mass displacement and sexual violence in Syria are absolutely not addressed by the Syrian government, nor by international NGOs. The greatest threat ISIS poses is its adaptability to external pressure, and its forces lack national training. For Syria to succeed it has to have self-governance, which it does not have in place in Iraq and Syria. This is not what the Egyptian Revolution took over Egypt and the Arab Spring didn’t work in Tunisia and Egypt’s Mr. Morsi has not achieved his economic goals.\nThe outcry over Syrian refugees reaching Turkey highlights the need for international solidarity in this matter, as well as any concerns over a completely incompatible situation between the West and Russia. There is in Syria a state of emergency to prevent the spread of transnational terrorism, on the pretext that many Russian ISOs are still in Syria, and that these Syrians are supporting Al Qaida. This means that there is no single voice for Russian values to turn on us, but the international community needs to do something about this crisis.\nOn the East Coast of the United States, this has been a major problem for Bernie Sanders. In a country with a population of more than 13 million, Americans do not appear angry with the actions of their own government. Sanders says that a poll published by CNN on Feb. 11 shows that, “I think the economy and ISIS really get on the West Coast of the United States.” As we said in February, Sanders helped launch the Sanders campaign in his home state of Vermont, and as progressive “bipartisan” candidate during the presidential race, Democrats have rallied to support a Sanders candidacy, with Paul Manafort and Kevin Madden as well as digital-media mogul Mark Zuckerberg and German journalist Matthias Jupp among them. Only 6% of Americans say that national security matters, and only 4% say it is more important to lead the country than contribute to the U.S. economy. The media, instead of reporting on the administration’s broader successes in a country with a population of more than 13 million, just supports them.\nWith so much emphasis placed on Putin, and the remoteness of the U.S. Army, President Donald Trump’s actions in Syria have produced events that are not held in public view. The Yom Kippur War, during which the U.S. navy was damaged, is not taking place in US cities. And all the Turkish and Russian gangs in Syria are terrorizing Turkish and Syrian people. This sounds like the most direct attack against global peace and stability in nearly a hundred years.\nThe failure of Congress to pass legislation to stop anti-Russian vigilantism in the United States stems from Congress’ reluctance to identify and do away with the oligarchic and repressive system that it has used to build a State, act as if it is not justified, and unify the country. This can be accomplished through the restoration of democracy and human rights, and by prioritizing the good people of the United States.\nA a healthy democracy is not only a legitimate political economy, but a global one.\n']"

150,‘A Heart-Wrenching Thing’: Hospital Bans on Visits Devastate Families,"[""In Russia, people spend months, sometimes years, trying to survive in the midst of deeply traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries. Throughout their trauma, they have multiple layers to their grief. As a result, they sometimes find the way out in any one direction. They try to get down to speed around on the country’s most traveled highways, but instead end up stuck in severe pain and disoriented. Some, like veteran teacher Rosanna de Souza, have stayed that way for years.\nSoon after taking her fall during a child grooming task recently, de Souza stepped out of the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit to make a suicide note. Though she had been called to a party where she tried to commit suicide, the medics weren’t sure how to proceed. After having put more pressure on her chest and considered the severity of her injuries, de Souza ignored her own advice and ran from the room.\n“I was in here with the children. That’s how the medics started looking at me,” de Souza said. As the families got to know the trauma they were seeing in their hospitals, she was placed in an isolation unit after having spent two weeks in the trauma center.\n“It started to make me rethink where I belonged,” de Souza said. “The kids said, ‘Dad. Man, Mom. Mom. You’re the demon.'”\nThough de Souza, with her wife and two young children, was reunited with family members, she was distressed that they were forced to spend two weeks without speaking to their trauma patients. The lack of communication with the ones they dealt with was also a bigger problem than her own trauma.\n“People who are running from the hospital, they don’t talk to anyone,” de Souza said. “It’s a shame it was not used to be that way. But just so people know, this is how children get at home.”\nShortly after de Souza was identified, the trauma doctors told her they could refer her for independent placement. De Souza continued her journey to heal and reunite with family, but the medication she needed was not needed. In turn, the medication she needed to live a life of wellness and physical health wasn’t in her system yet. Once she was informed about this, she started acting like she was ready to receive her medication. Now she can practice her fitness routine at home. She will be able to practice standing on the sidewalk and getting up before dawn daily. After all, breathing means a very low level of oxygen, oxygen starvation means fewer oxygen molecules are needed to enter the lungs, and fewer oxygen sources are needed to supply nutrients for the brain.\nDe Souza acknowledged that the opioid therapy she had been receiving that week did work, but she wished it had had a similar effect. After being reassured that she would get some of the medication, she went back to see her doctor for further tests. It’s unclear what the hospital did to update her on this — perhaps they didn’t know it was her last week.\n“I had so much fear and anger for the last four days,” de Souza said. “When I was told that I wouldn’t be able to get out of this alone, I had a sense that this was not really the right time, I didn’t want to go back to the hospital for further treatment.”\nWhile she’s thankful that she is alive now, she says she feels guilt and sadness.\n“You are so much more human than all this anger and frustration I have,” de Souza said. “Something bad is happening, right now. What do you do?”\n""]"
151,China Created a Fail-Safe System to Track Contagions. It Failed.,"['China has a system to detect flash points of flash flooding. There is an online charge, called “Juicao Master” that adjusts the payment for each place where the flash is released.\nThe charge isn’t exactly easy to find anywhere in the world, but every state or city was shortlisted to develop them. That’s why when we wrote about this last year, we said that China was one of the toughest spots on Earth for flash flooding. We provided an equation to illustrate the difficulty of doing this with a comparison of all China’s flash flood control capacity.\nOne example of the under-reported problem of flash flooding is cash smuggling in Hong Kong and mainland China. Hong Kong is an offshore-offshore shell company that moved deposits from China to Hong Kong for port duty in 2008 and 2009. The latter bank merged with another overseas shell company but didn’t allow Hong Kong to return.\nThe Chinese government understands what the problem is and they’ve reformed its system to help reduce the risk. So the trickier question is when and where that will be. And the trickier question is when and where that will be. From Paris to China, Japan, Singapore and the US, China has the largest flash flood defenses, the North Atlantic Basin has the smallest than sea levels and the most floods and droughts. Most of those things make the problem worse.\nThe firework is working. China set up a system to test flash floods even when they don’t have movement and where they happen, such as in flood waters in Mumbai and Banga. But there is nothing even halfway strong.\nThe problem with flash flooding and China’s “cloud-beacons” — the invisible filters to the coast that draw people into the sea to have photos taken at sea — has nothing to do with flash flood protection but it might do with turning flash flooding into an international emergency. Unless you can even see a flash flood in San Diego, then you shouldn’t be paying for it.\nWanted to get something out of the way so you can learn how it works.\n']"

Troll Farm is the most popular party by second place.\nThe politics behind Troll Farm have influenced many candidates since their rise to prominence, from elite primary members, to new members.\nCritics argue that, on account of Troll Farm’s tall buildings and humble nature, Russia could become a more democratic country.\n“The election results have become more and more realistic every day that is happening now,” said Alexander Vasitsina, a political scientist and associate director of studies at Grady University.\nVasitsina went on to stress that it is not too early to assume that Troll Farm’s popularity will disappear.\n']"

It’s mainly about rapid spread of the viruses, which can then spread rapidly, into other countries and beyond.\nRitually linked states are so-called “coordinated distribution points” of direct contagion, such as interlinked cell networks. Intervening countries and their central banking units (which is now encompassed by CAFTA), private organizations and banks are main vectors. The final straw for those conduits could be something awful like the flu (the virus is already moving onto other infection zones, such as India).\nThe risks are well documented. A top spokesperson for the State Security Intelligence Agency (SSI) said in March that the Chinese must face consequences for exposing infected persons to the spread of this disease, and that “if any terrorist group is found to be preparing to launch a specific and indiscriminate attack, their attacks on the public must bear the sanction of the State security agencies of China, whether or not they are terrorists or not.”\nOne openly-discredited Western investigative journalist pointed to the irony in this message, saying that “the slightest hint that the missiles or Chinese missiles may actually have been deployed to cover it.”\n“If the government of China is to insist on turning this virus into a threat to the country’s security, it will have to be assassinated by the CIA,” warned a clandestine espionage service, “and such a historic event could occur when cybersecurity is one of the most sensitive aspects of a foreign policy.”\nIn June, two scientists and an international coordinating cell came under fire for spreading a virus without informing the people or their governments. The Canadian researchers were charged with scientific defamation for their publication “InDepth of Computer Scientist Symposium,” into which they first relayed how damaging the AIDS pandemic is for science.\nTwo weeks ago, Olivier Rabinot, whose colleague in the project, John King, won an international physiology prize, appeared in Foreign Affairs’s Global Citizen magazine to argue that the U.S. is now misdiagnosing “extreme” AIDS cases rather than dealing with the massive problem. He showed why it is so bad and why it’s so fatal.\nIn a November 22, 2017, piece published in the International Standard, Rabinot addressed the author’s theme: “Why is the U.S. facing the problem of extreme AIDS?”\nThere is speculation that President Trump might ban the entry of Mexicans and Muslims to the United States. The Syrian election result is highly likely, given the terror-sponsoring Bashar al-Assad regime. Clearly, America has become overwhelmed by the logistical challenges confronting it – especially with the Muslim flight to Europe. Rabinot compared US interventions to “restoration of faith.”\nRabinot’s conclusion is actually quite reasonable in that what terrorism does is inflict the most devastating cost on humanity. Think about recent events in France: the bombing of an open-air kosher market in Nice kills 2,000 people. As the Islamic State war on Syria advances, many Europeans are leaving for Europe. The embassies in a number of countries have been attacked. In April, France announced it would be closing all French embassies following French theater attacks in Paris in November. French press often praise open-air and open-cultural areas, but France is considered an exception.\nRabinot describes the extent of the problem with an attack like this, noting that in a month, “Turkey was able to win this outcome, not because Syria did it, but because Turkey mobilized with nuclear weapons to fight the Syrian regime and did so for the first time since the 1967 Sinai Desert conflict.”\nHistorically, the #MeToo and #CapitalistPlace movements seemed to have given women pause when discussing feminism, in the belief']"

But it did call for continued operations on the border with Saudi Arabia and ending the humanitarian aid.\n""The United States wishes to do everything it can to minimize the damage to our people from the bombing that began in 2015 and other ongoing operations in Yemen and the region,"" he said.\nIn an effort to trim support for the Saudi coalition and US funding, Congress passed a two-year military budget on Tuesday.\n""The earlier passed that budget, the more you will need to draw up changes in the law, and I think there\'s a lot of them ahead of us,"" Trump said on the phone.\nCongress passed the bipartisan US$800 billion military budget for the US government last year, part of a $95 billion reauthorization of the American Civil Liberties Union\'s Freedom of Information Act.\nOriginally, the Pentagon included a provision that would have cut $110 million from the aid since then. But a negotiated two-year extension with Saudi Arabia that got a final floor vote in the House on Wednesday restored the funding. The two sides couldn\'t come to an agreement on raising that funding.\nThe funding reduction, however, was watered down by both the Senate and House Republican leaders. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Senate Republicans opposed the spending bill and urged Republicans not to follow Trump\'s lead and torpedo other international efforts to hold the Saudi bombing campaign and the blockade against Yemen.\nThat measure was bundled into an otherwise high-key spending bill to avoid possibly being sent back to the Senate for a vote later in the day.\nThe Pentagon budget cuts have been steadily outpacing $20 billion in reductions made by the Clinton administration and the Republican-led Congress.\n']"
161,"One Continent, Two Very Different Political Responses to the Pandemic","[""A recent paper authored by a 12-year-old Australian researcher, Brenda Perrault, and a British member of the Bulletin of the Communist Party Bulletin is known as “An Analysis of Tropical Storm Cartell.” She was joined by national security analyst (and member of research fellow at the centre of the paper's elaboration) Donald Leuse, who recently published his findings using British computer software. The research entitled “An Analysis of Tropical Storm Cartell, Subtropical Storm Free…A Curse for Risk-Relieving Viruss” is published in the April 19 issue of the Bulletin of the Communist Party Bulletin, but also in the paper, published last month by international government authority of Taiwan.\nCERTIFICATED VORTEX\nSenior Australian research fellow and founding editor of the Bulletin, The Australian Capital Territory Member and his wife, Elizabeth Lewin, are PhDs in International Political Studies at the University of Canberra, and they discovered Tropical Storm Cartell in 1999, formulating a three-phase projection system for the outbreak in its way. They were activated mid-2004. According to their paper, Cartell then “must be sustained during 18 days before it collapsed into the atmosphere,” a perfect scenario for the predicted calamity because the Agriculture department does not have enough forecaster capacity. Instead, they reviewed 23 agencies under their jurisdiction and learned that they were being fed by a typhoon in an operational group of international experts, CERTIFICATED VORTEX, in Changkodong, central Taiwan.\nThis geo-political system was implemented across more than 20 Indonesian and Queensland Queensland wendos to create a supervisory capability to verify and monitor the outbreak risk and for measuring the severity and duration of the outbreak to track progress across the territory. There were also on-going “intelligence intelligence community training missions” and 17 eXperience fact-finding missions. “In the 1988-89 and 1991-90 World Cup soccer season, for example, the Australian team and officials each slept on the teams’ reserves’ night pods and would track progress toward the game on the diving boards,” wrote Mr Leuse.\nPRIORITIES\nScientific research instruments, weather forecasting stations, detecting radiation molecules and monitoring the flow of water were essential. But there were six key issues important to the outbreak: the weather, climate, health and sea level rise, the quantity of water vapour, the level of groundwater being pumped from tree hollows, and the sea level rise and the frequency of typhoons. “Some areas would do well to add monitoring and local police forces to the flood control system of water pipes, for example,” said Mr Leuse. “Also, from a weather observation perspective, the hosting community’s own forecasts and satellite imagery were the source of these powerful figures.”\nThe members of the Bulletin were created in Darwin a year ago. They recently reprinted in the Bulletin of the Communist Party Bulletin the text of a report the Bulletin used for its research on the pandemic. These were scored separately and announced by the Indonesian authorities and were key to the critical case effect. According to the Bulletin of the Communist Party Bulletin, two experts were on the board, with Tete Tansu, the Indonesian technical and information director for the mission for the Australian and British defence ministries, and Heman Bektem Wongla, the director for international defence operations for the Australian embassy in Jakarta. The CERTIFICATION and disaster assessment organizations had 13 scientists on the board and their capability assessment boards were divided into four groups. The board assessed a total of 300 submissions for which 26 had been prepared. In an additional set of physicales which were available to a panel of 20 professional groups, more than 400 were prepared. Other areas on the board included events that could or should be simulated in order to establish the source and frequency of the plague, religious events, domestic disturbances, killing, and destruction of lands.\nCARALTY CHALLENGE\nThe report was commissioned as a follow-up to the Rosemount Group-2009 study “The Incident Culture: Targeting LTTE in Sri Lanka” published by this newspaper in Australia two years ago. This was based on one of the first international reports of the outbreak. So far more than 40 people have died, but CERTIFICATION is now the last piece of testing and evaluation.\n""]"
162,Coronavirus Briefing: What Happened Today,"['US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is reporting that men on an international route have been contracting the Escherichia coli infection with the type E. coli a common human disease. The CDC also has added several women who have had recently caught E. coli in their semen tested positive, and many more women have also tested positive. Since the infection is technically still a common killer, some people may not even realize that the disease is an emergency condition. Since they have already had the disease, some may think that they would have to vomit when they first learn of it.\nThe Escherichia coli bacteria remains distinct, becoming a particularly common bacterial infection in the early to mid-1980s, as well as 90 percent to 95 percent of humans. Since then, the effects of the spread of E. coli to humans have significantly decreased in population numbers, and no cases have occurred since 1949. The survival rate has also decreased, with just two cases from 1949 to 1982, and, the remaining nine cases from 1982 to 1983.\nThis disease is unusually serious, and usually is fatal in only one year. Earlier this week, another professor at the University of Michigan (UNMH) in Michigan (CDC) reported that pregnant women who were treated with hospitalizing antibiotics have fared no better at being infected, with 34 to 39 percent of them reporting negative results from the antibiotics.\nWhile the disease is still only two years old, such activity could be expected in people who have done not only kidney dialysis but also previously lost their immune system in the short time between incubation and start of their pregnancy.\n“The patients were likely treated for complications on those results, and they may be exhibiting more symptoms subsequent to their first year and pregnancy of the virus,” the researcher informed USA Today. “If the symptoms are not treated with antibiotics, these patients may also need to rest during the subsequent years or even for almost a year if they are still at risk of passing the disease to other patients.”\nUnfortunately, the rate of hepatitis B infection, an autoimmune disease which in recent years has included the virus in more than 110,000 new cases worldwide, remains low, but may be poised to go up by 30 percent over the next 20 years.\nIn an earlier version of this article, we did not include article distribution for the red blood cells associated with these viral infections.\n']"

164,‘We Find Ourselves Afraid.’ The Pope Confronts Coronavirus.,"['Pope Francis has inspired at least one case of bubonic plague while at the Vatican, and has charged the virus with spreading the disease.\nAnd so we pondered our Italian brothers in arms, wondering whether the pope may look too corralled, too antisocial, too uncultured, too unmonitored, too too morally suspect.\nA few weeks ago, he inaugurated a program of action on Coronavirus, a plague virus that can be transmitted to humans by drinking contaminated water and food.\nOn Monday, the pope met with 250 people at the Francis Family Door as part of the pontifical council’s “Spastic Week.”\nIn many cases, he boarded planes before or after boarding, including at London’s Heathrow Airport, and the Pope exchanged hugs with his audience.\nThe trip is not entirely new. In 1997, in the country of Northern Ireland, the pope was invited to the Vatican for a papal lunch. Then the Christian impulse overflowed with positivity and optimism.\nPresident Barack Obama’s popularity crumbled amid the economic slump of 2009, and predictions were that the pope might do well in his first term. Then the flu outbreak of 2009 — and then the widespread spread of several cases — made the pope’s jokes seem anti-historical.\nBut the pope is not new to the tabloids.\nThe Daily Mail branded the pope as “Mulatto.”\nDuring a trip to the Vatican in January 2010, a Muslim monk wearing a plaid cape rubbed sugar-filled chocolates to a girl.\nLater in 2010, Syrian spiritual leader Radwan al-Walid compared women of Middle Eastern origin to their “heroes” to eternally “elated or ecstatic.” He said it was “unthinkable” that they were able to speak the language of the “pro-Palestinian Arab Spring.”\nThen in 2013, the pope told the same story.\nIn 2011, the pope triggered a “religious earthquake” in Central America, spreading cases of measles and mumps. He introduced a bizarre new preventive screening program, saying that it came about as a result of careful selection of countries to apply a vaccine for the first time.\nNow the pope, who has done little to lower our expectations of what his first term will bring, has courted controversy by taking a similar approach to measles and mumps last summer — and the number of cases of the virus in the United States fell precipitously.\nThe pope’s most recent argument against vaccinations falls upon a particular theme: that given the chance, the disease might eventually prove fatal.\n“This has been one of the top issues in my life,” he says. “I have tried to find and kill diseases.”\n']"
165,Shielding the Fetus From the Coronavirus,"['Image: PBS\nHumans and other microbes can be vulnerable to various viruses including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and other types of disease but if taken together, the severity of disease can be considered a trigger for infection.\nScientists at South Carolina State University and Georgia Tech conducted a clinical trial in mice aged 10 to 77 and high school students with advanced Alzheimer’s disease, which was not an easy target.\nResearchers identified a parasite called Adlyptlylysidides (Adlyptlylysididides), which infects humans and other microbes that grow in the intestinal lining.\nThe researchers also studied whether growth of Adlyptlylysidides in mice caused respiratory illness in patients.\nPupils in the study were required to stick needles into the gut of the mice and repeated to raise the levels of Adlyptlylysidides on exam paper when entering the study. The study examined the likelihood of respiratory illness in early-stage AD patients by tracking immune cells and by measuring how much Adlyptlylysidides.\nA typical AD patient may have between 1 and 3 percent immune cells. However, in younger AD patients, AD cells can be as high as 1 percent and less than 1 percent in AD patients.\nThe FDA approved Adlyptlylysidides to treat infants with advanced Alzheimer’s Disease. In addition, Adlyptlylysidides to treat diabetes can be converted into an immune system component in mice that affects the development of Alzheimer’s disease.\nCarrots and chicken feet may produce antibiotics, which interfere with bacteria and potentially spur other infections.\n“When you are choosing for a child, it\'s really about what is the impact you\'re having on them. It\'s about how aggressive you are,” Dr. James Cardy, visiting professor of medicine at South Carolina State University, said.\nResearchers want to know how AD patients respond to medications that might be given in this way, making their treatment more susceptible to the virus and the cost of eradicating AD infection and preventable diseases.\n""We want to know where your disease is from, what kind of autoimmune disease is that, who are you really fighting, to help you develop well and take care of yourself while learning to live a healthy life,” Cardy said.\nAt a future date, Cardy said he hopes researchers will track the AD population when AD symptoms are considered with the treatment schedule.\n""I think this is an important thing. I think AD sufferers are not the only AD sufferer. They are also very at-risk of getting Alzheimer\'s, and it\'s a tough disease for them,"" Cardy said.\n""It\'s an important part of the conversation to know where AD sufferers are and how to respond. But we need to remember that it\'s a disease that requires a really, really long time to manifest because it does take a lot of courage and determination to survive.”\n']"

Authorities said Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman tried to kill Khashoggi in Istanbul but was foiled by an order issued by his father who had been in office for a year and a half.\nAl Najjar said Riyadh was also hoping that Jeddah would receive evidence of the Khashoggi killing.\n“Is this a resolution that might address some of these issues and we shall wait till there is something more concrete,” he said.\nSaudi Arabia recently welcomed the idea of a state-sponsored international investigation.\nBut the kingdom’s overtures to lay the groundwork for a state-sponsored investigation — one led by US investigators — haven’t been enough to satisfy sceptical Sunni U.S. allies, many of whom see Khashoggi as a Western Western martyr.\nAl Najjar denied Saudi officials had told the country there was no evidence that the journalist, who entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul the day of his Oct. 1 visit, was killed or harmed.\nRather, he said, the investigators ended up with a “perfect” set of information.\nBashar al-Zawahri, the Saudi king and senior figure in the kingdom’s leadership, told Al Najjar and other officials the kingdom wanted to “create a situation where the evil which had been committed, which was happening for the past five years, must be examined.”\nIf to ask for the Saudi Commission for Human Rights to investigate Khashoggi’s death, the Saudi Commission for Social Affairs would be required to come in contact with the government of Turkey, which has so far refused to cooperate.\nIn Washington, the State Department said it was sending a letter to Saudi Arabia asking for “an expedited investigation” to answer questions raised by the Saudi authorities.\n']"

172,"As Life Moves Online, an Older Generation Faces a Digital Divide","['Last week at CES, Comcast presented a new digital standard that would go far beyond the already existing standard of 802.11ac (Gigabit ethernet) wireless devices—it would also be the first of its kind to allow access to the Internet of Things (IoT) through lower-bandwidth wireless routers. The company also revealed that it is in talks with a number of companies to include the switchable endpoints in their emerging IoT wireless devices.\nSome commercial solutions to use the switchable endpoints might not be ready to be deployed by several vendors in the coming years, but it’s safe to say that speeds in the ""hardware-centric"" segment have been off limits for some time. It’s a symptom of a new digital divide that may be affecting sales of baby set-top boxes (TVs), office equipment (stations), and even transportation.\nAdvertisement\nSpeaking to Wall Street Journal Asia, Steven Gumpel, the founder and CEO of CRO Labs, stated that the continued unwillingness to license products that companies cannot build on thin thin bit of metal at will and to access the network directly is fueling the perception that that sector is behind adoption of digital devices. ""The more we are able to monetize that, the less we are going to get foreclosures,"" Gumpel said.\nGumpel’s current take on all of these concerns is that devices, with everything from Bluetooth in case one fails, connect to the Internet, connect to WiFi everywhere, connect to consumers’ TV set set-top boxes, and do all of these things in real time without ever taking an actual circuit board.\n""We have devices made under license that connect to the network without any programming attached to it,"" he told WSJ Asia. ""It\'s completely unsustainable, without cost, with very few consumer manufacturers able to license that kind of technology to competitors. There will continue to be limitations placed on that type of equipment. To the consumer, it has more value to connect to your computer or phone than any other technology.""\nNow that everyone is used to the new standard of 802.11ac 802.11n, Gumpel cautioned that regulators aren’t rushing for action either. ""It should be approved this year,"" he said.\nWith more data coming online (uploading, converting, and sharing this information), Gumpel said he expects the industry to see more adoption of 802.11ac receivers by 2020. The latest deal would be for a router with a fast Gigabit connection for consumers who want their device to be faster and get data cheaper.\nThe ""fully immersive"" technology is nothing new, but there are a few technologies that people are getting excited about at the moment. The first of those is the Trusted Technology Alliance’s (TTA) product being designed to help consumers watch TV and see if their TV is ready for 1080p. So far, TTA has been testing how to use the Trusted Technology Alliance’s technology in a consumer-facing manner and has demonstrated a prototype program called Discovery Fiber Fiber that let people watch smart TV content with far more speed than standard Internet connection.\nNow TTA’s product is a truly “connected” television with display technology that TTA hopes will enable people to keep watching content in the home without having to visit a shopping mall every day.\nTwo more companies, Ericsson and Samsung, will be releasing devices that use a different standard of 802.11ac 802.11n, a company called Skylink Product Development which makes devices that connect to a commercial network.

174,"After Exposing Corruption in Russian Courts, He’s Now in Jail Himself","['By Valerie Volcovici\nThe Georgia judge who exposed what he had thought had been a Democratic Party machine in Ukraine into coming into office this week has all the makings of an extraordinary abuser. Here’s why:\nThe special counsel who is now investigating the actions of the U.S. government has recently brought charges against the head of the U.S. intelligence community in a criminal investigation. The Wall Street Journal reports that Robert Mueller, the special counsel overseeing the investigation, is being dragged through the streets of Moscow by others, including the American intelligence community, who called for indictments of the person who ordered the false speeches given during the campaign and the leaders who stood up to the Hillary Clinton administration. Some in Russia — and around the world — are concerned the new charges, covering various speeches made in the homes of Ukraine’s pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, were not in line with the free market policies that Russia promised.\nThe presumption is that the charges are politically motivated; the Moscow-based American intelligence community — which accused the authorities of hurting protesters at the Maidan protests in March — says that it has nothing to do with the White House, but rather with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. But even if Mueller’s investigation appears to be spinning against the motives of American officials, it would not be nearly as hard to credibly pursue it as it is to suspect an aspect of Russian political fait accompli: Hillary Clinton’s campaign connections with the Russians.\nIt’s not just the charges being drawn against Alexander Litvinenko, either.\nTo be sure, Litvinenko, a British agent who was killed in London in 2012, lived far from the buccaneering rule of the Kremlin and the interests of its despotic leader, Vladimir Putin. But for the tens of thousands of people who turned out at Moscow’s Novaya Gazeta for the Pussy Riot protest in January, it was something else. Things only got worse after a long national debate that focused on the role of Russia in the free world and around the world. The protest, in particular, shocked and shocked global political activists. If the Putin government can go to the international courts and say that it wants to prevent the U.S. from doing its duty in Ukraine, then it ought to be prepared to do more than what the U.S. government is using its courts to try.\nThe charges against Putin are potentially explosive, and if they prove as successful as the accusations against Litvinenko are, Putin will have only one way to deal with it: “He’s putting on a face that hurts him,” one Russian official told The Washington Post. That was Lukas Podolok, the lawyer who warned of the government’s possible action against Putin and who made millions of dollars for advocacy for the case.\nPutin has already publicly condemned the treason of Litvinenko, making it clear that any prosecution of him against Russia is against all international rules. The suspicion is that there’s likely to be an easier path to take in the U.S. to force Russia to investigate a Russian public figure for treason. That comes at a time when Putin is playing to a growing country that seems increasingly receptive to the false opposition being made out of Russia and the opposition against the U.S. in general.\nIt’s clear that Putin’s violent impulses will be getting through, but it’s more clear that there’s going to be a list of people going over the top in their reporting that Putin can use to make what he views as a false claim about the U.S. possible.\n— Valerie Volcovici is the author of Anti-Americanism and Crime: The Truth About the U.S. and The Russia of V.H.I.T.\n']"

I feel that now I’m making my living playing guitar in this precinct, I know that they are still going to rat me out,” he tells Rolling Stone. “I’m in the band now, I’m sitting in a shop and I put my guitars down for about an hour and a half.”\nIt was on his way to the get-ups that he lost a cracky habit and began smoking a “fight” pipe during his heyday. A decade of smoking later he acknowledges “it’s never been that weird” to drive around with a hollow skull on the passenger side of a moose, trying to hide everything in his tiny booty.\n“I can’t really put out that much and really just feel disinterested in it,” says the 5ft10in native, whose mum and dad served time in a South Vietnamese jail after being convicted of rape and murder. “The rock ‘n’ roll of this group, I believe, is what does that awesome thing feel like.”\nHaving worked in the industries full time before trying out acting with director Kevin Smith, he’s now working with the folks at Dreamworks who plan to remake “The Butterfly Effect,” for which they’re distributing the network’s TV commercials for its slate of new shows.\nIn 2008, he starred in the indie film, “Caddyshack,” which was adapted for TV. “I hadn’t really thought about it,” he says. “But I started thinking, ‘OK, here’s how I feel about it, just doing my thing in this not-so-little accent.’ I was like, ‘You don’t have to. You can just do what you do, do what you dream about.’\n“When you put a monkey in there and put a beat down on a dog, that’s pretty insane to sit down there,” he says. “Some things are way better than other things. But that’s just the basic premise, you need to be positive with your own skin.”\nSuch positive words are all he is seeking for this year as he launches his Downtown SoundWorks project, which he hopes will give the neighbourhood a bad name following a spate of similar projects happening across Vancouver’s area. After all, here’s a project you might expect to find candidates in the neighbourhood and have them on the street to dance that way.\n“If I can get somebody in trouble and give them a break, the future of the neighborhood is so much better,” he says. “Otherwise people would see it and talk about it or talk about how much fun I have in this neighborhood. But I’m hoping that people come out into the open and say, ‘I do want to do this, but I don’t want to get robbed or anything,’ and that it’s a positive thing.”\nA killer new instalment in his mop of red is due on 3 June.\n']"
176,A Lucky Country Says Goodbye to the World’s Longest Boom,"['While Jamaica has been at the forefront of long-lived tourism, it has been at the forefront of obesity.\nThis is all the more notable because Jamaicans are notorious for overeating and are among the most obese in the Caribbean region, despite the fact that the nation received extra tax revenue last year to pay for health initiatives in 2011.\nBetween 2011 and 2012, Jamaica scored a 44.1 per cent increase in obesity rates, from 15.1 per cent to 15.6 per cent.\nAlthough Jamaica maintains a somewhat restrictive approach to food labels and in some ways, it’s still had a tough time embracing obesity more than others.\nWhen, in 1997, British retailer All Saints withdrew its guidelines on food labels that featured items containing fat content, the Jamaican Department of Health reported that just one in six of more than 800 stores regularly offered sugar-free foods.\nA recent “health alert” was adopted by the Jamaica Agency for Development of Health (JADH) in collaboration with the Jamaican Government’s Food and Agriculture Ministry to advise on how fast and how easy it is to stop eating sugar in Jamaica, and how to make money on the menu, and how money should be spent on food purchases, with sugar between 70 per cent and 90 per cent of the items being rolled out.\nBoth government and JADH had been working with the health ministry to revise the guidelines, and last year the ministry conducted what it calls the World Health Assembly’s (WHO) Health Impact Assessment which evaluated the model and how it could best be implemented.\nJADH’s Health Impact Assessment is a summary of priorities and goals across a variety of options which can, at times, pose additional health risks.\nThere are four principal areas that are lacking in Jamaica’s national food guidelines, and these areas were identified during the MEAA-4 process.\nFoodborne diseases (EODs)\nJamaica was by far the most at risk, having been identified in a high mortality rate following the establishment of the current disease of EODs. On average, the epidemic of EODs occurs in the Caribbean region per 1,000 people per year.\nOther immediate risks\nObesity - Many Jamaicans think they have less than a fair chance of eating sugary foods, leading to the fact that many people say they eat many sweetened foods. Fruits and vegetables such as carrots, mangoes, bananas, and potatoes are the most sought after foods due to their antioxidants and fibre content. People also purchase whole grains, low in fat and high in fibre.\nDespite problems associated with obesity, JADH notes that the focus of the early diagnosis in the communities of light cardiovascular risk factors is a high priority.\nNutrition improvements\nThe new data in Jamaica’s food-maintenance plan for 2016-2020 shows that six of the 10 strategies identified so far in the plan suggest that other strategies to improve the health of the Jamaican population can be adopted.\nPositive progress towards an improved nutrition diet is likely to benefit local populations more and more. Studies point to an increase in cardiovascular status and increases in the likelihood of heart disease and stroke.\nSaving health and ensuring a healthy lifestyle\nThe improvements JADH is calling for continue in the areas of reducing emissions, reducing physical activity and reducing health-related fat intake.\nIn this regard, if Jamaicans continue to eat sugar-sweetened food, Jamaicans will also do better with healthy lifestyles through improving the sustainability of Jamaican nutrition.\n']"

''There is a trade-off you can take to be humane. When the boat goes missing for two or three days, how do you have a plan for the return of the Rohingya people to their country?\n''I'm thinking it is time to speak to the (residential) managers on this. They are looking for a code, have that decolonisation regime for the regime, and declare the Rohingya country - to the detriment of people such as the Arakan refugees that they now call ''Bansunsoom''.\n''I think we should start the dialogue with all the homeless people and refugees in Rakhine State to begin to examine the international mechanisms that are there for working with the refugees.\n''The members of the Asian Customs Union have been taking a decision to allow them to flood in from Bangladesh. The problem with that, is the Chinese regime has now supported, allowed inroads, to cross the border.\n''It is fairly simplistic, this is a problem you solve if you take out of context a large-scale invasion of that region.\n''I think that's the reality right now.\n''We are on the run. There's nothing we can do but help them rebuild their economy. I think Myanmar is on the run now.''\nBut the Australian government's response to this challenge could be met with denial of the gravity of this situation.

It’s being vaccine-dependent, contributing to new and often larger outbreaks than previously thought, and available to any medical, health, or spiritual practitioner.\nThe products that give E. coli and salmonella stick close to the surface of the bloodstream in food, water and blood: some are loose, others bind directly to blood and vomit.

180,What if Restaurants and Pubs Disappear in Australia?,"[""Australia is the only country that has a law requiring the establishment of a 'pubcy' (or beer license) in order to attract bakers, beer retailers, restaurant, garden center, pizzeria or other farmers' market.\nThe law covers these types of establishments, but, if restaurants do not catch on in Australia, then it can only become enforced.\nIn an article published by the International Business Times, Kokosé surveyed over 5700 people from all over the country who collectively raised concerns about “pubcy” and other “state-sanctioned, recreational and involuntary exclusionary restrictions.” Among the respondents, 74% said they knew no local restaurant was exempt from licensing, while 53% reported the news, to the dismay of some of the respondents.\nIn the article, European attorney Yves Roy told the media he was surprised by the results. Although most of the comments he made in his comment were positive, many of the respondents that expressed alarm saw their industries become truly “dissolved” in Australia. Additionally, the survey also found that restaurants are no longer able to open in communities in the path of conflict.\n“I fully expect that there will be a heavy lifting on issues concerning [environnement] in Australia at the beginning of 2020,” said Roy, adding: “It’s particularly worrying that bars face similar restrictions while the barbers traditionally have a higher profile, with their proximity to the property,” according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\nHowever, don’t expect the ban to change in Australia until 2020, at which point retailers may be “cashed in,” giving consumers a choice of many different style options to overcome local challenges and even face the temptation of passing off the same canny strategy on to restaurants that are already open.\nThe test of whether or not “pubcy” is successful, however, will be the outcome of a national consultation on establishing a new industry to bring awareness to the concerns and the discussion on legalizing certain types of establishments.\nAt this point, it is highly likely that bar owners will follow the advice of Roy and others to follow the advice they have already been given by law enforcers, but at this point it is also well known that a local law could very well require that more restaurateurs utilize the alcohol aisle in order to offer tourists an entirely different experience to them.\nAccording to Roy, the planned legal establishment testing regime in Australia won’t solve the same problems that Irish pubs lack in their cafes and restaurants when they had to persuade the Irish bar folk to make a move when they became control-free breweries. If the government has decided to take the job of establishing a law that governs bar owners, it is wise to consider whether or not it is appropriate to create a new establishment that will serve the entire Australian community and not a biki bar.\nAnother cautionary note: Canadian dollar investors with large size net purchases generally have extensive knowledge of the value of Canadian dollar interest rates and they prefer to invest in Australian dollars rather than Canadian shares. A move to an Australian dollar index is a smart move, and it would likely help ensure better return on their investment if a bar owner keeps a small presence on their bar side.\nIt is not yet clear whether or not alcohol bar owners will try to circumvent all the restrictions in Australia.\nSources: Australian Business Times, MediaGuardian\n""]"
181,Airlines Tell Employees to Prepare for Difficult Times,"['Following a deadly passenger train collision in Canada in December, airlines have adopted mandatory actions to reduce their carbon footprints that should continue to enhance the airline’s overall performance, according to a new report from Monster.com.\nThe company said in a report that its August 2019 report identified 105 countries with an average of more than 10,000 kilometers (about 23,800 miles) between points for as many as 66 percent of the company’s 2,300 carriers.\nRelated: F&C Rolls Out Fresh and Improved Goals For 2050 in Australia’s Southern Transport Scheme\n“The focus of the report was to create information for customers, since it was important to offer guidance to the entire airline industry on the elements necessary to be most effective,” said Robert B. Bergne, president and chief executive officer of Monster.com.\nBergne said those building scalable, sustainable fleets are key to a sustainable airline, and look to the “low-emission routes, low-cost gateway hubs, and expansive co-working spaces” such as hotels to serve the needs of its passengers.\nHowever, he warned that even if airlines are able to steadily reduce their carbon footprint, changes will continue to pour in at an alarming rate.\n“Fiscal year 2020 is going to be very, very challenging,” Bergne said. “You have a very aggressive battle going on, and of course, the cost and environmental impact is going to be significant.”\nThe travel advisory said numerous airlines are attempting to either shift their business from specialized ones to more personal zones such as beach gyms or shopping centers to meet customer demand.

There are currently more than 1 million cases of Hormuz in the United States.\nFrieden said the emergency declaration added $2.7 billion in emergency funds to the federal response.\nAn aid package totaling $500 million that the CDC and state governors and four congressional members received in January requested new supplies and equipment for U.S. ships as well as for each of three states that provide food and water to eastern Asia.\n“We look forward to sharing our recent successes in fighting a global disease pandemic in a bilateral bilateral security agreement that could help us combat the new threat from Hormuz while cutting US costs,” Frieden said.\nThe US$230 million emergency declaration is the latest in a series of steps needed to contain the world’s worst epidemic, which has infected more than 40 million people, according to U.S. health officials.\nIn Beijing and Shanghai, the government announced the biggest beefed-up federal response for the current outbreak.\nThe Japanese meteorological department on Thursday posted photos of the new Hormuz outbreaks on its website, with the message: “If you ever visit Taiwan, please keep an eye on your local government’s electronic medical records and your health summaries.”\nSimilar intense weather-related outbreaks and shortages of medicine at some stations have also caused rationing.\n“The earthquake-ravaged Philippines has created a shortage of medicine for critical patients in multiple locations, most of which still require basic supplies,” the Philippine health department said in a statement on its website on Thursday.\nAn epidemic of the Hormuz virus has been afflicting China and Vietnam for decades, with the most serious diseases in the south, the east and Southeast Asia often plagued by rogue strains that control the virus.\n']"
183,Migrant Farmworkers Whose Harvests Feed Europe Are Blocked at Borders,"[""From the ThinkProgress / Elizabeth Hasselbeck:\nContinue Reading Below\nThe Trump administration is retreating from a much-criticized wall at the migrant crossings from Greece and Italy last year, reversing an earlier pledge to reopen a specialized processing center at the Vatican that had been locked away by EU and US government officials. Following considerable backlash, the Trump administration was loosening its position in March, permitting temporary customs and immigration detention at the border. However, several migrants said that the Supreme Court's March decision to let some migrants from six European countries use a feeding center at the U.S. southern border affected their ability to apply for asylum, which could provide a window to those people.\nGreece last year became the first European country to admit four asylum seekers - almost 200 children - to its southern border.\nSince then, this seems like a relatively minor issue. It should be noted that in Italy, the smugglers of migratory migrants often hire animals who provide valuable labor for the course correction process.\n""]"

Researchers tested chicken samples collected from 2017 to 2018.\nThe virus killed 35 percent of infected chickens, increased the risk of spreading the virus to humans, and has killed more than 98 percent of people, according to Zhang’s research.\nIn total, there were at least 1,567 human deaths or “recovery” related to the disease. The virus is usually transmitted through bites, skin contact, flushing or coughing.\nThe virus is known to cause a lot of pain and discomfort to humans and their pets, and causes rapid inflammation in the skin, causing inflammation in the lung, according to Zhang’s research.\n“Vive crescents”, or open pet carriers for dogs and cats, is likely the most common form of infective disease. There are no safe vaccines for viruses, and no treatments for the virus, according to Zhang.\nZhang’s research is the first from Austria and the first to consider gene expression in an infected human.\nWomen infected by the virus are hospitalized for two months to one year, depending on length of their immunity.\nXiaofeng Feng of the World Health Organization’s Zika Foundation said the study is the latest proof that microcephaly, an almost unheard of disease, is under control.\nScientists said microcephaly is caused by a protein that is built up in mosquitoes. It causes microcephaly in males and can cause brain disorders in females, warning pregnant women, even those with a first-born fetus, that they risk developing and growing microcephaly.\nThat’s why the Netherlands’ new epidemic, with 5,722 cases, is the leading virus in the country. The virus was discovered in 2009 and scientists now believe that for every 100 cases in the Netherlands and Germany (both countries were experiencing vector-borne diseases, such as Zika), a person infected is 250 people.\nIt remains to be seen if the virus can infect humans. One way to determine if there is no such virus is comparing how acute the infection (complicated enough to maintain its function) compared to a harmless infection, Zhang said.\n“It’s not too late to contact someone, especially for those infected with virus,” said Zhang. “We will try to determine what the next step is, and focus on getting the best [treatment].”\nReuters/Bloomberg\n']"

191,Online Help to Stay Sober During a Pandemic,"['Imagine praying to save a newborn baby or to live a quieter life for yourself. Now imagine helping a group of people who have a hard time living in their homes or communities find a solution to their problem, and your life just about comes off.\nHomework is a cherished piece of household stress relief but in the end, it isn’t always, and this strategy has its drawbacks. One of the best ways to do that is to use a friend, given with the right training, to help close the program.\nThe difference between social assistance and internet help is a matter of hindsight. Many are familiar with the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) online help for people living with mental illnesses and substance abuse. But that is only the beginning.\nOnline help is not a static interface, of course, with more sophisticated devices now prevalent to help people cope with various chronic and medically debilitating illnesses. One tool for this is AliveFacebook, which allows users to post personal stories of a topic on a shared website. Naturally, after securing the user’s full profile, or when the site is re-touched by an advisor, the viewer views a list of frequently discussed topics and a summary of the recommended daily schedule.\nThe website is an ideal forum for those in the early stages of the problem. It’s perhaps different from the personal details of social assistance programs such as PASA, where users can share often sharing specific personal needs or provide feedback to a service administrator. But being able to share the recommended daily schedule in one click is a great thing for people whose symptoms are still significant enough to not require therapy.\nAnother tool for Facebook users is iGeneration Profile for a different kind of anonymous friend, where profiles that have been filtered by an advisor are used to populate the pages with people with an ethnic background. Some social assistance websites, such as Link.iGenest, allow users to create a profile and then contact the social assistance offices via text or email.\nWondering if anyone can help you? Since the service is anonymous and anonymous, the social assistance staff can’t determine who you are, can help you with any of your social problems or are inactive so Facebook don’t prioritize the service as a zero-sum game. In the event of an emergency, Social Assistance staff will help you make emergency payments as frequently as possible, the Roadmap to Recovery initiative concludes. This is especially important to those at high risk of mental illness, including the elderly.\nThe article “Where Do You Choose How to Raise a Family With Facebook Users?” originally appeared on JTJ News.\n']"
192,Significance of Pangolin Viruses in Human Pandemic Remains Murky,"['Out of five studies that have so far examined samples of the sexually transmitted virus (STV) released at the end of 2017, the most conclusive finds were in both grey and blue area between grey and blue levels. The grey cell count at the 50-600 threshold was the highest in the study, while the blue cell count was highest in the analysis of certain immune cells (MYCs).\nG. Ferdyue, a researcher at the Institute of Salk’s Center for Human and Molecular Microbiology, said in a press release on Friday that the M. thekylnga circulatory secreting degenerative polarity was reported into the tests “under cross examination.”\n“Overall, however, H. thekylnga is very weak. The infection is hard to interpret,” Ferdyue said. “There is still a large subgroup of STV transmission that appears to develop in the laboratory environment. Now, we’ve determined that this episode had a potential response from the human M. to cytomegalovirus (CMV).”\nThe M. thekylnga circulatory secreting degenerative polarity was reported in human up to 60 milliliter samples, which includes many of the 96,586 YVA-44, UVA-CYCL agonist thrombophila H. superbug and 171,152 T-cell methylbromylbutterase monoammonus, or Tamiflu. These experimental lesions were reviewed by immune pathologists in the lab and 16 of them subsequently formed after assessment of the laboratory evidence. Four of the eight so-called white blood cells/red cells was examined, with three those actively infected with the virus and three deliberately picked up by doctors on the M. thekylnga PCR/triple-TXH-706 and 568 LDH-TR199v.\nFerdyue said the prevalence of STV infection in human samples in the laboratory is still unknown, but that there is no out-of-pocket cost to diagnose STV infections in humans.\nH. thekylnga infection in humans is among the most common of these diseases in the USA. It is generally associated with progression of STV and has a transmissible pathogen, MRSA (melanoma skin cancer), which is also an element of the infection. The exact cause of this virus infection is not yet known, although in certain cases the MRSA infection causes new lymphoma to enter the blood stream.\n“While infections such as STV infection have received no attention in health records until now, we do know the influenza virus can cause MRSA infection in humans,” Ferdyue said. “Along with infecting human cells, meningitis is a common infection. The combination of this virus and the flu outbreak has left many people to seek the best prepared immune system possible.”\nThe investigators are looking at patterns of inflammation in viral compartments (small red and white cells) in 1,140 lesions and 478 lesions between the QH1ST Melanoma (also known as ILLT) and the VEGF HPV macular degeneration (VEGF1). Additionally, the investigators are investigating MRSA from either hepatitis A or HPV.\n“It remains unclear whether there’s a treatment or cure to this viral infection, but we are continuing our investigation into infection,” Ferdyue said. “We are clearly seeing systemic inflammation that causes HIV and also a presence of HIV phylogenics in viral compartments.”\n“There is also potential for human plaques to form on some of the M. thekylnga and as these are always active red cells, this is a serious public health risk,” Ferdyue added. “Our goal now is to take all relevant samples from the laboratory and amplify them. This is already well documented in studies published on human genomes and more studies need to be done to confirm the implications.”\n']"
193,Australia’s Record Heat Means Another Blow to Great Barrier Reef,"['CATENS’ eye-popping heatwave brought global temperatures to a record high near Australia and the southern Indian Ocean and quickly killed one reef community, which struggled to thrive, and sets a course for another meltdown, two conservationists said Monday.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported a 20.8 degree (30 Celsius) heatwave over the last two days in northern India, putting severe strain on the Great Barrier Reef since the summer rains caused the formation of a massive dune formation that lined up with global temperatures to make far reaching waves visible.\nThe phenomenon was triggered by the recent rains, which broke the previous record earlier this month in the Indian Ocean. Satellite images provided by the remote islands of Malami, Laxmad and Nayagami also showed what the islands of Kainandu, Ejara and Katina — the largest islands of the reef — had seen over the past few days.\nWinding up for the second successive day, much of the Western Australian reef appeared to have run out of life. Incredibly, they had been caught by the large seas that had filled their reservoirs with heat from recent rains, with more than 3 feet (1.5 meters) of rising water expected to turn to jellyfish by Wednesday.\n“The islands of Laxmad and Nayagami have so much water, it means there’s still a lot of life around them,” Aman Catarano, director of the marine and coastal programme at the Australian National University (ANU), told Reuters.\n“And not only sea water, and consequently weather events like this, climate change could potentially continue to change marine life in the Pacific and especially in the Pacific Northwest,” he said.\nThe Canberra-based Friends of the Great Barrier Reef (FFR) said the impending parched days, coupled with more than 880 million years of ocean water lost over the past 400 years, would only exacerbate the problem.\n“By the time storms bring dangerously high temperatures back into the Western Australian Great Barrier Reef, we will have let ourselves into a vortex of near-record-breaking global heat,” FFR scientists said in a statement.\nThe FFR team, led by Andy Russell of the University of Adelaide, who has been researching for decades the hazards of heat waves, warned that the mercury rises from the heatwave could start to turn into ""devastating dunes,"" near the beautiful reef.\n“Another Australian national embarrassment is that this catastrophic heatwave can easily result in another disaster,” said David Haile, at the Australian Sustainable Endangered Species Day on Monday.\n“If unchecked, future events can seriously threaten one of the world’s largest economic, cultural and ecological treasures.”\n“As an Australian and Canadian resource, it’s crucial that we keep the reef healthy. We need to phase out the needs of a continued global warming catastrophe,” Russell said.\nThe reef reached a peak in 2011, standing at 370 billion liters (190.3 million tons) a year, making it the world’s third largest reef.\nIt was again under the microscope this week. On Saturday, the aquarium complex was evacuated because of continuing heat. Residents in the ancient patchwork of coral colonies around the reef will be allowed to return later this week.\n“They’re enjoying a good time,” Vincent Petely of the think tank Local Alarm said. “They’re getting homes so they can go out and do their job.”\nBut Pacific Islands health officials warned that the heatwave could cause one of the world’s worst coral bleaching events. A report from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that the amount of juvenile coral bleaching on the reef is set to top 1.3 million, equivalent to the same number of life at the ancient reef.\nLike this article?

They yelled \'food poisoning!\' at me; \'em saying pizza\' at me and making me breakfast,"" Gill recalls from the soiree at Bozeman’s Bar and Grill. “I said, \'I’m ready to lose my shirt.\' In the coffee shop, this woman, she said, \'I’m going to eat chicken.\' She’s completely comfortable with it. It was funny, just making me really uncomfortable in the group. She gets a lot of zillion bug bites.”\nHe never showed up. He instead found himself in a tornado that brought down a pretty good chunk of cabby shop owners in Bozeman.\nEarly this week, the deadly twister plowed through American Midwest neighborhoods, killing four people and injuring 30 others. The massive destruction — three houses by the name of Lazaro Collazo — was likely caused by large grass trimming by El Salvadoran anarchists.\nGill knows exactly what a disaster this would be. He lost his eight-year-old daughter.\n""This is my worst nightmare, that my daughter would be through this,"" he says of the ordeal he and another 8-year-old daughter got into after leaving their hotel in Portillo, Neb., for a night of sleep in a pond.\nAs a young boy in his early 20s, Gill remembers his first tornado chugging through Nebraska, first in a large barn and then an Oklahoma farmhouse, ending at Dewey’s Dining and Bar, the full-line bar in South Bend.\nFinally, Gill found food so high it shut down the nearby restaurant in Portillo, and he felt terrible inside.\nBy the time he woke up, he was unconscious, but buoyed by the people he had encountered on every street corner.\nFive hours later, a tornado ripped across the area, killing five people and injuring several others. The Buffalo Bills’ season was ending, and Gill was so engrossed in the game that he slowly broke down as he opened up the window of his pickup truck.\n""I couldn’t tell. I thought it was lost,” he says. ""It was very dark at night. I watched the TV. It was heartbreaking. I am still trying to get over this. [Still] thinking about everything else — that b**ch and that guy.""\nHospitals looked like hospitals — near alleyways from Duane and Duane, near farms — filled with patients unable to get to the end of the road. Things got worse once the line wasn’t reached. Gill found himself sitting in the dark, looking to the sky from the deck of the pickup truck.\nAs he was being transported, a professional trained in biology and emergency preparedness got up to see a contractor pilot his ambulance.\nBut, Grimm says, he soon realized he had just not heard what the scope of this tornado was.\n""He just kept saying ‘anybody that looks like this is on the ground. They’re there, they’re going to hit you,’ just flat-out traumatizing,"" Gill said. ""I know that woman. She looks like me to my face.""\nGill pulled his hat and gloves from his shirt pocket and spent a few moments looking over at each of his neighbors. ""No one went in to see me,"" he says. ""So, with no thought on them because they loved me, I did what I had to do to stay alive.""\nUntil then, he was stuck in his house, wondering just how many people came after him. But before long, his father and six of his friends came out and helped him prepare for a good meal.\n“It was very important,” Gill says. “To me, it was the last thing I want to hear from the family in this crisis.”\n']"
197,Judge Urges Release of Migrant Children After 4 Test Positive for Coronavirus in Detention,"['The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia has granted a request to release four undocumented children arrested since the beginning of March, and warned that they could face juvenile detention and potentially deportation if they fail to show up for their detention hearings.\nFederal authorities apprehended the children on March 30 in the San Diego detention center of Florence Regional Detention Center, under suspicion of suspicion of screening illegal immigrants for exposure to the Coronavirus, according to CNN affiliate KPHO.\nA spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services said that the agency was aware of the children’s parents’ suspected involvement in the work of Coronavirus, but did not know whether the children could be held indefinitely.\nHowever, in April, the Department of Justice approved a nationwide order requiring mandatory detention for people with serious and chronic illnesses that may arise in domestic facilities with fear of being released from custody.\nRelated Coverage Security in Detention Review Confirmed for Children of Exploited Child\nThe Children’s National Medical Center in Atlanta, which shares the same facility, confirmed that the children have not yet been removed from custody and submitted an official evaluation to the department, but said that its staff is still concerned about their health.\nThe children were taken to Children’s Services’ Brenton Park Regional Detention Center, a state-run facility in San Diego, until June 20. A detention hearing for them, which was set for April 27, was postponed until July 13.\nIn his ruling on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan directed the Department of Health and Human Services to provide additional information regarding the children’s health and future cases.\n“Children may not be released without reasonable cause,” Cogan wrote. “The request to release these children also raises additional troubling questions about whether their interaction with either of these individuals has any connection to the threat posed by Coronavirus.”\nThe 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington held in September 2018 that the Children’s Department of Health and Human Services had failed to provide information about the immigrants’ health and future health concerns.\nThe case is Stoner Kids.\n']"
198,Coronavirus Slowdown in Seattle Suggests Restrictions Are Working,"['Health experts in the Bay Area have detected a significant, nationwide slowdown in outbreaks of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in Seattle that appears to be overstating the severity of the disease.\n""There has been a large amount of research showing that the issue of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease doesn\'t seem to be based on increased virus production or advanced vaccine production,” Michael Powers, the study’s lead author, said in a release.\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob infections, which can cause death or serious destruction in the event of a full-blown illness, are generally uncharacteristic for these relatively new viruses. From 1998 to 2003, Creutzfeldt-Jakob cases ranged from 0-a-gal to 550,000 cases.\nWhile the epidemic rate has gradually increased in Seattle, the number of new cases has also declined since the epidemic rate has been steadily increasing. In the first three months of this year, there were 46 confirmed cases of the disease compared to 50 in the same period last year. More than half of these cases were caused by an influenza virus.\nThe least well-documented causes of these infectious outbreaks vary among countries. These cases are found in each country, according to Gus Senterfand, senior medical epidemiologist for the American Association for the Advancement of Science. One pathogen reported in one country is a mix of influenza and non-Hodgkin\'s lymphoma virus. Another pathogen, known as HbA1c, is spread from one person to another during an active flu season.\nThe researchers analyzed data on cases and outbreaks across 44 U.S. states and counties, who compared three risk factors for influenza cases in each county — regardless of their geographic location — according to a statement released on Thursday.\n“Large swaths of our country are now getting fresh outbreaks,” wrote Powers in the release. “This suggests that consistent initial antibiotic use is not one way to predict the likelihood of causing a severe reaction.”\nPrevious research has shown that even airborne inflammation in airways that are normally connected to infected airways could be a contributing factor in causing a sickening reaction in this kind of outbreak.\nPatients’ body fluids are sprayed with two types of chemicals to suppress the germs in the lungs that have entered the bloodstream and can cause people to develop a serious reaction.\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, “a virus that infects the respiratory system with an infectious low-grade illness is highly contagious and can cause a major response in a very, very sick person in its wake.”\n""Severe outbreaks could raise numbers about 15 percent,"" Senterfand continued. ""These can then require special preparations, including keeping patients in a small cleanse of their bodies — and vaccinating them against the kind of vaccines that patients should use.""\nThe Health Department is now recommending patients seek the doctor’s advice before taking any public flu shots, but Powers cautioned that the CDC does not have an official data base on which to base its recommendations.\nThe institute says it is especially worried about using antibiotics in flu-related outbreaks, citing them as having the opposite effect on flu-causing bacteria.\nFor more on this story, see Newser.\nGet the latest Stanford Medicine stock price here.\n']"
199,"In a Town Where Meth Is Eclipsing Opioids, Everyone Feels the Pain","[""When I and my partner met Ronni Kresock in the streets of Ireland 17 years ago, the empty drinking pit was what made our relationship end. Both of us had been in an argument (asked what made the next point of disagreement) and we both felt the pain in our heart.\nBut when we broke up I got up, sat down, and left the action behind. I can’t say that is satisfying to us now. It’s nearly impossible to have such a crushing disappointment in your life and when I am with my partner I tend to weep; as uncomfortable as it is, I won’t regret losing him.\nBut what happens when you compare apples to apples?\nYears ago I started a movement to ban the consumption of whiskey. It's one of the biggest causes of addiction. In many areas of the world, Prohibition meant we drank from bottle.\nPoliticians let it happen. One by one they and their constituents ended up with popular bills to ban alcohol based on the prescription of its illicit drug use. It was a disaster and we got mugged out, as well as ones for planting the wildfires and digging our own coffins, or legislating these stupid laws through the Criminal Justice Reform Act. I wrote a letter to that vast national legislature asking that it ban “inexplicably flavored” alcohol.\nIn the great panoply of the British towns where the most wanted prostitution towns were advertised, cops could only question customers trying to purchase a thing called “sex,” while most residents had to survive on sweet cabbages and dishes that didn’t even have the “notes of spice” built in them. The biggest problem with the ruling class’s monster addiction to liquor was the sheer number of people smoking, and it was widely seen as the easiest way out. And you could never have had any change without the new laws. So it was a natural reaction to enacting laws in an open state. People were forced to obey them.\nIn other states, including Scotland and Wales, this changed. No longer a brand new and restrictive law-abiding citizens would have to buy from an open seller, buying from older and less lucrative citizens without asking a bartender. They could drink and drink. Demand cut out of the equation.\nBut now, instead of being broken up by accident or by an idiot, there's something happening. At the end of a long line of people waiting to collect a Budweiser, everyone tells us to stop mixing for the long haul. Society marches along with it, unless you actually have the willpower to break free from it. I believe that is precisely the point. It’s the potential to a few grains of salt or something should end up with everybody the world over as having it felt that we were. A bottle of something you haven’t smoked or drunk before.\nIt's not that we don't deal with unpleasant habits, or that our behavior is acceptable. It’s just that we live with the same bad behaviors and wrong moves every day, with us and them.\n""]"

201,‘A Heart-Wrenching Thing’: Hospital Bans on Visits Devastate Families,"['Tonight, in New York City, a nationwide day of protests, emotional sweats, and sadness continues to gather over the tragic killing of these two victims. A few miles away, at Grant Memorial Hospital in Brooklyn, one families were left devastated over a horrific event that left seven people dead, mostly teenage boys.\nPolice have yet to charge a suspect in these tragic events, nor has a motive been found. In the wake of the news, hospitals across the nation are now facing furious criticism, including from public health experts.\nThe debate, however, has recently changed. As a result, doctors, nurses, and other hospital workers are beginning to look to see if they’re being held responsible for the local-level. According to a report in the Miami Herald, doctors from Cottage Grove Hospital in Minneapolis — Moline High School’s School of Medicine — have been involved in a nationwide case of standardized testing that they say is fueling the rising tide of families looking to fix the system.\nThe stories about those families have included fears that medical workers who actually perform sick passes are being held responsible and misused. There have been far more protests in California than elsewhere. In Colorado, the State Assembly passed a law specifically addressing the use of psychiatric services while held “continuously.” In Washington state, a law passed gives doctors and nurses the option of banning visits from mentally ill patients who are mentally ill.\nJust two days later, the Medical Council of the United States issued a “Notice of Public Health Emergency Response” that local doctors must “engage” in every interview with families about care. According to the City Council, the city council was also given two hours to take notice of the problem and mandate that what happened should never happen again.\nIn order to avoid being deprived of these family visits, providers must start immediately reviewing mental health care and on-the-spot evaluation of mental health services.\nDr. Michael Donoughing of Cottage Grove Hospital said in an interview with the Boston Globe:\nWe are doing what we can, creating partnerships with mental health providers, all partners, to work collaboratively and, obviously, to create a framework. We also have to look out to the communities on the ground, the neighborhoods, and [folks] everywhere. We’re not here to cherry pick a particular mental health provider. We’re here to work with those providers. We’re not here to strip a child of his or her services. We’re not here to take away any of these services. That’s how we’re providing care. In the end, people know what they’re getting. It’s a devastating thing to see it happen, especially in a developing country. [The local P.O.V.] group is critical, and we’re working to get that integrated together for a chance to do that, to figure out what exactly they need to do to have those same services. I don’t want to be in a position where that’s going to be tolerated. But I think it’s vital. As much as we can look to make that happen, I don’t want this community to have to look to racism for that reaction. We’re working with local health care providers to figure out what the individual needs are.\n(Click here to read the entire story.)\n']"
202,How Russia’s Troll Farm Is Changing Tactics Before the Fall Election,"['According to the paper, a pro-Trump political group created their first “lavish” scandal, when they picked seven Facebook employees to push something they argued was “very bad for President Trump.” Those seven nominees were Mark Zuckerberg and his son, Bob. The shift in their priorities has potentially far-reaching consequences.\nEach hire directly got NOCs, which were essentially a form of second opinions — and good ol’ troll cat hunting. An exchange between an anonymous person and the post itself revealed the denigration of both colleagues.\nTwin recounts of the new command:\nWhy did the second official staffers ever get these positions? Because of an exchange of emails over the weekend. — Mark Zuckerberg (@MarkZuckerberg) April 1, 2018\nTo look at this in context, you’d think an FBI officer would be completely open to such things, only to find this to be Trumpian. It turns out no one is.\nMention that the two ideological fellows were ostensibly just friends and agree on who to call every day for extended periods of time, thus making the overlap unmistakable. But one is dubious.\nAccording to what they’re saying, for this issue to really happen, I think it’s far easier to distance yourself from the term, not your public politics. So if a person deliberately eschews trustworthiness for the third person, I don’t think it’s likely for him or her to win on Day 1.\nBut for whatever reason, Zuckerberg is not living in the ether.

Additionally, political advertising can be targeted to mobile devices.\nFor voters, the survey “will know what voters want and ask them how they want to vote,” said Nate Silver, research director of the nonpartisan Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy. “When we learn what they want, our platforms will be able to make them more democratic and ensure a good turnout.”\nIn the online sphere, an online ballot is used to select a political candidate in less than 1 percent of households; requiring a wide range of platforms that are available online will not be as easy to purchase. On the mailing list, volunteers will be contacting existing mailing lists. The analysis can also be used to estimate how much time, and administration fees, is required in order to assemble online lists that can be used to select a candidate.\nRelated Stories \'Money for Thought\' is Busting Politicians Is What Unveils Distraught Faces at the Pundits\nIn a few states, ballot-in-boxes are now ""accessible"" to voters. On the federal voter registration map for each state, constituents can vote by mailing a monthly ballot affidavit, unpack the candidate database, and then vote again on a date stamp or in the mail.\nWhile there are 1.25 million qualified voters statewide, there are around 25,000 ineligible voters.\nVarious age restrictions could limit turnout on election day. Thanks to the state-by-state database compiled in 2017, this could be a problem, says a study released in February by NYU’s Political Economy Lab.\nWithout the required identification, many people are less likely to vote, on the other hand, whether that’s due to voting a provisional ballot or standing on the ballot cast by someone who hasn’t had the ID in the office several years earlier.\n“Even when the state allows people to vote, we’re still not able to mobilize with the best of intentions,” said Adrienne Merold, a political scientist at NYU’s Foundation for Public Democracy. “There’s a lot of confusion about election day, and that’s a big difference from voting in a field like Iowa or New Hampshire.”\nThe challenge for voter advocates, advocates for traditional elections, and politicians, to communicate in addition to addressing the problem is that technology alone cannot combat the problems. This means creating online platforms that support meaningful election monitoring, avoid unacceptable voter impersonation, and play practical voting games that we rely on to fix election security.\n']"
204,Is the U.S. Headed Toward a Short British-Style Election?,"['Contrary to popular belief, Mr. Trump doesn’t run for the presidency — he’s just doing what he’s asked.\nWith the prospect of Donald Trump being “the next president of the United States of America,” he’s taking his chances on something that’s not a done deal: a “short British election.” Or, as his former pollster says, “Not really.”\nHere’s the problem:\nMr. Trump is taking this to mean that the middle class is smaller than the populist masses, something that rightly upset British voters and would likely spark heated debate. It also raises concerns, including possible elections in the U.K. under a non-British leader, in which he could disrupt major areas of government, especially with the success of Brexit negotiations.\nThis stance suggests that the British would deal with the election, unless they had a successful turnabout on Brexit, or Brexit with an election too!\n“With Brexit, the British voters get fed up,” Imo State Governor Rochas Okorocha, the Vice-Presidential Candidate for Mr. Trump’s ticket, told The Times of London in a recent interview. “They voted because they had to. They have to have a change. That’s the objective. And the date of our election is our election.”\nThere’s no reason for Mr. Trump to start picking fights with them. The Brits are his voters, too, and should never allow their instincts be swept aside.\nThat said, it’s highly unlikely that the U.S. was really going to agree to support a short British election, even if it hoped for a better negotiating position than the one found in Brexit. Given how much every part of Europe’s political map the U.K. has changed over the last century — traditionally heretics to the idea that the success of a free trade deal would help the U.K. — doing it just on the same day as Brexit is yet another step in the U.S. thinking about whether it wants to bring back home to suit the next president.\nWhat Mr. Trump is likely to do is negotiate with Britain about its exit from the EU, rather than with many other European nations such as France, Germany and France.\nIf he wants to reach agreement with Britain, he could make it by dropping the withdrawal agreement which removes Britain from the single market (London’s passport free for all EU citizens), pushing back against the European Court of Justice’s ruling that his presidency was a crime by ruling Britain out of the World Trade Organization’s rules of proof, and doing other things such as making his party more Eurosceptic by saying he was only following the same “Brexit” as the previous British prime minister David Cameron — all without being “Brexit.”\nIf he does, he can use this to try to get other countries to become “part of the movement” as in the U.K. would generally say, so that they wouldn’t worry about their sovereignty.\nBut are you ready for a U.S. he’s going to try to cajole and torture?

All the guidelines will be voluntary, meaning any concerns about infection and the lack of any reference to specific needs will have to be addressed at its own discretion.\nThere will be no attempt to offer pregnancy advice and birth information for older patients.

Harper also was a fugitive with outstanding warrants for failure to appear for bail and possession of marijuana in Lincoln and Gloucester counties, and required a driver\'s license for failing to report numerous traffic violations, according to the state superintendent\'s office.\nHarper, whose maiden name is Andrew, was being held Sunday afternoon on charges including murder in the death of his wife, who was found shot to death Friday in their home in Plainfield.\nPolice released surveillance images from a nearby condo where Harper and his son live, including his dark sunglasses. Police also linked the Sunday sighting to that of Massachusetts Bay surgeon Kenneth Oberloh, who was last seen with Harcourt\'s son, who remains missing.\nHarper is described as an Irish American born, former Army infantryman and his parents, Roman and Cecilia, lived in the area.\nAuthorities were able to locate the boy Saturday evening. An officer located the child and his father through a pit of concrete and gravel from the pit, police said.\nOnce the boy got out of the pit, authorities found a 4-foot-long gold plated rig and a small life vest in the search area. The rig was donated to the North End Shelter for children.\nSince the discovery of Harcourt\'s and Oberloh\'s bodies last month, there has been a complete string of missing children and parents who are believed to have been left in abandoned homes.\nAuthorities believe the child was strangled with a rope, apparently cut to his neck, and that he probably was subjected to sexual abuse, police said.\nIn the area about a half-mile from where the search was launched, Massachusetts deputies found four adult women who, according to county officials, were missing for 3½ weeks. The mother had scratches on her chin, and relatives from at least four other homes were found.\nWhen she disappeared, her family said she had been found by a friend who had discovered her body in the woods at L-295 in Uniondale, 30 miles northwest of the Massachusetts city of Bedford.\nThe search was suspended in December, though a message to users on Facebook asked them to be vigilant about sexual exploitation in Massachusetts because ""even though there may be any images of runaway children or adults in the \'emergency.\' \'We don\'t believe any images to be sexually exploitative,\' nor would it be responsible for a picture taken of runaway children or adults,\' reads the message.\n']"
210,FEMA Says at Least 7 People at the Disaster Agency Have the Coronavirus,"['FEMA and other federal agencies have alerted nearly 7,000 people to be on watch for the Coronavirus Virus, with cases confirmed so far in Michigan, Tennessee, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, North Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Virginia, and Virginia.\nThe virus is known as ""rivera"" in the United States. At least 18 cases have been reported since January, and 16 cases were confirmed in Michigan.\nAccording to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Coronavirus Virus is an organism that can cause severe fever, conjunctivitis, muscle aches, convulsions, vomiting, and diarrhea.\nThe disease is also transmitted through bodily fluids, such as saliva, sweat, and urine.\nFEMA said it had not had a case of the Coronavirus in 12 states yet, but reported eight people who have been confirmed in Tennessee. In Illinois, an Illinois man said he had contact with a ""pop up"" of young men, when no-one else had contact with him.\nIn Tennessee, death threats have been made against the state Medicaid program for Medicaid fraud.\nIn Kentucky, an apparent thief nabbed a trooper\'s arm and coat Friday. A Lexington Police spokesman said the man, who has not been identified, is wanted on several felony warrants for theft and burglary. The same day, the Secret Service advised that the museum located at 1379 Highway 99 in Belton should stay closed while the investigation is played out.\nIn Louisiana, a grand jury indicted a white man on five counts of bribery for allegedly taking bribes, including $1,725.\nIn Michigan, one person has died of the Coronavirus and two are in serious condition. A female woman who was struck in the head with a dike Friday morning was in serious condition. She had just flown back to Michigan from Arkansas.\nIn Mississippi, another elderly man has died from the infection, The Associated Press reported. According to CNN, 15 other people also have been confirmed.\n""These numbers really are not going to be random,"" Tom Donahue, governor of that state, told ABC News. ""The fact is we\'ve got to look at the impact of the disease on Michigan.""\nHe went on to say ""everyone knows"" whether Mississippi would be hit hardest.\nFEMA said it has also received another 1,500 reports of total confirmed cases and 3,500 isolated cases in Michigan.\n""Let me say this,"" Donahue said. ""You can identify any patients and say, \'I heard from a patient who has the septic defect,\' and, to a certain extent, you have that third concern that people want to be scared, they want to be scared to tell their doctor.\n""Most of the cases are that patients are dying. It might be in two-to-three weeks.""\nRecovery from the disease can last four to 12 months, Donahue added.\n""We\'re not wasting any fuel,"" Donahue said. ""The Corps knows what we\'re doing and what we\'re doing to prevent this from happening again.""\nThe story said roughly $1 million of relief will be available for anyone who needs it.\nIn other USDA news, the Army Corps of Engineers has awarded $300 million in additional federal grants to fortify the Everglades, and the US Marshals Service has announced that it has deployed 11 divers to the region for 5 percent of all medical training for natural disaster resource experts.\n""Water, energy, roads, sewers, marsh marshals, farmers\' bores, and gale-force plant closings are being done to protect the ecosystem, put more critical structures at risk, and promote better resource stewardship by moving resources around,"" Richard Degnan, superintendent of the US Marshals Service Southeast Region, said in a statement.\n""Using the force and investment of eminent domain, it will be possible to reforest and rehabilitate many more productive farmland so that wildlife can migrate and molt back,"" Degnan said.\nEarlier this week, EPA officials said the Great Lakes and Great Plains had been at risk of flooding. The agency said additional dam closings were likely on the rocks around the warning areas, as well as forecasters and officials at three rivers near Milwaukee and Bridgeport, as more lakes are expected to crest between Saturday and Sunday.\nThe agency also said agribusiness giants like Bunge and Archer Daniels Midland now have certified bridges from the Missouri River to parts of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Indiana that will carry soybeans to market.\n(With permission from Joshua Sasse)\nRead the original article on Reuters.

212,"U.S. Civil Rights Office Rejects Rationing Medical Care Based on Disability, Age","['Transforming it seems like less than two years after the release of research showing that using a cardiologist when a death could be avoided by hastening the patient\'s life is unwise. This is not the first time that American doctors have faced backlash. Since the publication of a study on patient association reform last month, Missouri doctors have been writing citations to paper arguing that change is needed. And, last month, Congress passed legislation stripping the AMA (American Medical Association) of its power over what people can take, even if that person\'s disability makes it hard to risk changing an agent\'s lifestyle and productivity. Here, we take a look at the case of a Missouri physician who told a patient that from his heart\'s perspective, should we be careful about planning for unexpected stressors.\nThe case of Paul Chen has raised concerns about the impact of medicine\'s method of ""health care"" on the lives of some chronic mental health patients.\nChen is an internist from Houston, who is affiliated with Austin Health System. Chen went to a major hospital in and out of state to do care for his disabled brother. The brother was on the brink of a serious serious illness that resulted in a death of multiple sclerosis. While continuing to function, he told Chen that after taking medication and surgery, his doctor refused to fix his problems.\nChen sought help, seeking advice from a neurologist who recommended the follow-up treatment. In doing so, he began to feel better. When he finally received a diagnosis of Graves\' disease -- a disease he described as having ""everybody get killed,"" from within and through his body, through after the surgery.\nWhat the illness did is not just a blood disorder, but an incurable condition that ultimately -- somewhere along the way -- got relegated to the basement basement. Although it may have had some affect on Chen\'s spine, it got him through his life, building on him and enhancing his capacity to move through life.\nHowever, most patients achieve this function when the brain finds meaning, meaning that the use of their cell phones and texting to and from work is often in direct response to their expertise or the nature of their job. If health care providers do not know they are putting patients\' health and the lives of others at risk, they are breaking with the practice of treating risk factor-based mental health. In this sense, a patient can become locked in a psychiatric ward -- a fear of the patient, which can affect their well-being or cause them anxiety.\n""We\'re trying to get things reversed, because when everything happens so well, nothing goes wrong,"" said Prof. Rubina Suleymanyapalli of Columbia University School of Medicine.\nWell-being is an individual\'s prerogative. In other words, each patient is treated based on how well they are feeling and feeling well. The benefits to a patient range from not suffering to maybe missing a dinner party by a few minutes and going to the doctor at least five times a year.\nBut unlike other medical care and decision-making systems, a patient has some dignity and ability to make her own decisions. To speak up is to speak up for what a patient is doing or doing with. There are also certain types of mental health professionals and independent bodies that enable some patients and others to complete their grieving process.\nSubmission of Proclaims\nSome patients are simply not that different from others or do not want to cause problems. Under the contract of a patient, a doctor must decide to accept the patient\'s requests for help, based on a three-minute consultation with him, as long as his primary concern is moving his life around. After every two years, if he says yes, the hospital agrees to take two smaller contracts. In these medical contracts, doctors usually treat the patients as separate patients -- without any responsibility for health care.\nDoctors often keep patients on solid, well-formed course of treatment despite the fact that they are not patients at all.\nThe submitter of a post from Georgia on midweek Seeking Buries Fresh in Baylor County, it appeared on Techblog. However, the article contained at least some inaccuracies, and it has since been removed from Techblog.com.\nTout el Zavem, director of the Southern Institute for Healthcare and Social Policy at Johns Hopkins University, summed up the problem facing the medical profession in this statement:\nProprietary side effects are being brought to the forefront, and we need professionals and communities to step up to the plate. But less attention should be paid to the problems that are being created by the dysfunctional labeling of substances that cause schizophrenia.\nMore from Techblog.com:\nPutting ALS in Obesity: Understanding How Genetics Fuel Stereotypes\nHypertrophic Pigmentation, Causing Memory Loss in You\nThe Readable Wireless Stress Test for Men\nWhy Things Happen When They do, Where Are They at']"

214,The Race for Virus Money Is On. Lobbyists Are Standing By.,"['Amanda Nierman, chief commercial officer at consulting giant McKinsey & Company, is speaking up about the need for lobbyists to be paid.\n“There has been a great deal of support in the media for legislators to sell a virus bill,” she said via email, and before we started commenting on the financial implications of the bill, she added that she hopes that “[s]on it it is passed the outcome is the best one we can hope for, given the lagging in the public sector.”\nRecent polling, however, suggests that most Americans don’t favor the idea of getting money from the government to support the virus bill. The Rasmussen Reports poll, out last week, found that 54 percent of respondents think lobbyists should contribute at least “a few thousand dollars.”\nStill, there is a huge demand for accountability. Newspaper reporters are under particular pressure, and the Knight Institute is funding a poll of reporters to take an accurate look at the effect the bill is having on their coverage.\n“The legislature does not support an after-tax incentive for lobbyists, like direct benefits, to lobby. That benefit is important to many reasons, including that the proceeds generated from lobbyists’ lobbying – through their public sector private partnerships – will go toward clinical research, education, and public health in the United States,” the editorial page of the Sacramento Bee reported.\nDespite the task of reporting on the issue to newscasts, one thing that doesn’t seem to concern me is that it would cost money to get people to become better citizens and that the bill would rather be passed by the ballot than the inside on the bill, Nierman explained.\n“It’s a real budget issue that needs to be part of the conversation,” she said. “I hope it is included in the budget in [the] 2020 budgets.”\nI like this political synergy very much, and I don’t think the absence of funding for the research also means that the bills are lying out of focus.\n[Image via Joocci/Getty Images]\n']"
215,Instacart Shoppers Plan to Strike Over Coronavirus Protections,"['OCC is testing new wait times to find out if consumers can use Coronavirus protection codes — following coverage in another small Texas pharmacy.\nWalmart users will be able to identify the virus or it can be treated on their own.\nConsumers have begun testing additional testing, with workers already scouring car’s diagnostic area for a novel strain. And while consumers first learned they had Coronavirus infection March 22 at Amazon, as they hit around 10 Walgreens stores throughout Texas, including more than 50 IISx pharmacies, by April 1, that could move much faster.\nChris Padgett, operations director at Walmart’s East Texas store, alerted Walmart customers recently that they needed to test for the virus Monday, April 3, at 10 AM.\n“If someone shows up, we’re giving them the test codes,” Padgett said in an interview.\nAlthough these retesting requests are being processed using an algorithm, he says some changes have occurred in what he is sending to customers that can be beneficial. Those changes could include some new privacy protocols — for example, whether those codes allow for detecting via fingerprint recognition.\nBill Coggins, a consumer representative at Amazon, emphasized the “great expansion in testing privacy.” The next step is for someone at Walmart, potentially communicating, and others, not with local customers, he said.\nWalmart today also unveiled PrivacyProtections for Coronavirus Affected Me, which adds security measures for those who send ScanInPass text messages without scanning of an app. These policies also include knowing how many scans Walmart scans the most often, and actually sending sent scans.\nThe apps also provide a set of privacy guidelines for whoever signs up for the device. If you send someone a ScanInPass text message that tells you you’re scanning a device, the app won’t know who sent the message. Walmart will also make sure the person signed up to the device doesn’t recognize you or the app or its content — or the overall look of the app, according to Padgett.\nThe second step is for app makers to create a product, Padgett said. These devices are able to scan individual files, images and videos, and their buttons to get into the hands of some consumers — who might then use ScanInPass to filter what they say.\nCopyright 2018 by KSAT - All rights reserved.\n']"

In addition, its European partners will hesitate to accept it.\nThe EU has spent decades contending with what it considers a failed structural adjustment system in which the dollar makes up a small share of its value relative to the prices of goods and services on the continent. That was the price in post-Brexit Britain.\nRead: Here's why Britain would love the American 'backlash'\nWhy? Because, with Brexit, the nation creates many more opportunities to negotiate opportunities for cheaper and secure labor across the Atlantic. That makes several calculations curious. Should the United States engage? The U.S. president promised to get out of the global trade war and that may not happen. And European bureaucrats will shortchange both Britain and the United States, meaning that they will have to consider directly how the government of that territory would respond to the threat of an outside force on its door.\nIf the United States ultimately does pursue deals with the EU, where will it share the risks? Which countries will best spot in this cycle of disruptive development and unrest that no one expects?\nHere is how countries work together to make the most of the transition time before such agreement and friction ceases.\n1. U.S. stays engaged: The big question.\nSee figure 5: why the U.S. will continue to play a vaunted imperial role, at home and abroad.\n2.

Sure, the U.S. government has announced a series of striking curbs. But, to Americans, Trump is like the Dalai Lama.

(The air pollution didn’t stop there, however.)\nIn addition to parts of China, people from India, Cambodia, Kenya, Indonesia, Russia, Uzbekistan, India, Pakistan, Vietnam, South Africa, Angola, Uganda, South Korea, Iraq, and Uzbekistan have been implicated in major causes of air pollution, including poisons like selenium from the coal sector, poisonous mononucleosis from chemicals like mercury, and human death from exposure to toxic chemicals, according to the BBC.\nOne Asian American leading the push is Governor Paterson, New Jersey’s governor for 28 years.\nIt follows a visit to Paterson by two top U.S. climate and environmental officials and other officials who believe the state is at a critical time of need.\nDr. Mark Milam, director of public health for New Jersey, and Marcia Thomas, the health commissioner of New York, are among the 50 Asian American leaders who are flying to Washington in the lead up to the October 18 edition of “Restrepo.”\nCurrent efforts are focused on protecting Indian-American communities, fighting against global warming, and advancing civic engagement.\nReluctant to take part in climate change talks because of decades of activism, the two ethnic groups first teamed up in 1971 to promote a multi-million dollar plan for cleaner, cleaner air in local communities.\nUltimately, their efforts paved the way for the founding of the Clean Air Partnership, which pledged “to reverse substantial [Environmental Protection Agency] and Congress [libraries] cuts that favor the fast-growing fossil fuel industries.”\nWrote The New York Times:\nThe Clean Air Partnership announced that it has been awarded funding from the EPA “for my work on water quality and the rapid reduction of pollutants in my house in Ocean,” which cuts arsenic and lead poisoning by nearly 90 percent and increases the dioxin and cadmium levels that are found in many wastewater. … A quarter of the state’s water utilities also received funding to enhance drinking water and fight pollution.\nThe “Refugees: Climate Change and the Democratic Party” clip is below.\n']"
218,"Facebook, Google and Twitter Struggle to Handle November’s Election","['MUMBAI (Reuters) - Facebook and Google, focused on connecting people across its platforms, have stumbled at the expense of key national and state political parties ahead of their November 2019 congressional elections, U.S. technology market analysts said on Wednesday.\nMany voters, especially junior members of parliament, cast their ballots for what is already one of the most vulnerable congressional races in the United States. The next elections will be held on Oct. 19.\n""They are lagging behind, some are even causing problems with the election,"" said Dr Marjorie Scardino, a technology equity analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nSuch disappointing results could worry investors who are mostly looking to avert a potentially negative outcome for the tech sector in the wake of corporate scandals and tax increases in the United States.\nInstead, investors will turn their attention to the fact that early primary elections, two early presidential contests and an expected battle to unseat Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the November 2019 presidential election will offer a chance for social media companies to show they have figured out how to work together better.\nFacebook and Google have already found their workforces, or lack thereof, to fight against re-elections and elections. Both rely heavily on their virtual-and-minted incumbent politicians, along with partnerships with polls ahead of the general election.\nBut they are also slow in deploying their funds. The two companies have struggled to do so with advertising already costly and lacking political or electoral clarity.\nAn expected reverse in the campaign phase will help explain why Facebook and Google want to keep spending on advertising ahead of Nov. 8 as opposed to relying on media votes, according to multi-tenant equity analyst Scott Wright.\nFacebook had $2.2 billion in its money when it reported its first-quarter results last week, less than a week after it reported $56.4 billion in revenue.\nGoogle\'s $4.8 billion in revenue is still less than half the sum Facebook made when it reported in October.\n""Tackling the digital ad response may be one of the most daunting challenges facing large companies,"" Wright said.\nThe firm declined to comment.\nAfter growing its revenue by more than 30 percent in the fourth quarter last year, Facebook had to quickly change its marketing strategies to improve user experience. It also failed to address advertising to voters, while running its own businesses.\nIt now seeks to protect its site and tightly integrate its services, while others switch to different platforms, such as Apple and Google.\nUntil recently, Facebook had committed to 40 billion daily active users across 25 platforms, up from six billion at the beginning of 2016.

219,The Race for Virus Money Is On. Lobbyists Are Standing By.,"[""Before the election, about 200 U.S. lobbyists helped get Dodd-Frank passed, according to an analysis of campaign finance reports by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. The report also shows lobbyists spent $4 million of their own money this year on lobbying for Dodd-Frank.\nHere’s a look at how much money lobbyists spend lobbying for Dodd-Frank.\nFrom Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington:\nLast year, lobbyists were reimbursed for a total of almost $4 million spent lobbying for Dodd-Frank, the regulations the federal government enacted to curb financial abuses in the banking industry. Members of Congress disclosed their spending in December, which came as fallout from the financial crisis. So far this year, there have been more than 250 charges against a member of Congress for lobbying for the banking industry during that time period, and over $8 million of that has been disclosed by outside spending groups since Jan. 1. The full list of lobbyists implicated in this time period is:\nAlan Barrios & Walter Gargiulo, Sr., Lobbyists: Campaign for DeK. Is a lobbyist: $650,000 campaign for DeK. Representative: She calls for her re-election and says she’s campaigning on her ethics bill; lawmakers: Councilor Samuel Baveh, 44th District: $250,000 campaign for former Chairman of the Public Employee Finance Commission: $158,000 for former Chairman of the Professional Taxers Association of Florida: $186,000 campaign for Florida Institute of Technology graduate student: Offers an ethics plan for the students and studies they have written to the Florida Institute of Technology University: Free trade pact in talks; Farm Bill 2017, financial deregulation law renews oil subsidies in 2026; audit: Federal auditor's report comes back with shocking finding that the Congressional nuclear tax is designed to boost revenue\nThis is what lobbyists have spent in recent months on fighting the House Financial Services Committee’s recently approved resolution about the derivatives commission’s bogus study of AIG’s underwriting of toxic mortgages. House members: Hashed pages of paperwork for a $7 million DTC study, and so far this year, senators and other members of Congress have lobbied on the presidential candidate who opposes the new resolution, at least temporarily.\nBut if you’re going to lie about it, we’re going to hear what you have to say here. Lobbyists mostly talk about a crisis they don’t have a clue about, a plea for accountability that keeps them away from votes from Republicans and Barack Obama that threaten or curb Obama’s achievements.\nYou can understand why this is happening. Because the nature of today’s financial crisis keeps growing. People want to put their financial futures on the line.\nThe Bank of America scandal lets Congress get away with this kind of behavior. Congress has come close to abandoning Wall Street members. They’ve had the leverage of saying their products are not bank risk, and they’ve failed. The new commission’s seven critics are all Democrats and have been portrayed as being above politics. Now that the BofA scandal is behind them, what’s next?\nRight now, lobbyists don’t have much of a choice. They can either continue to pressure lawmakers to pony up more votes or stand by, as some have been doing. Again, they don’t have a choice. What are they going to do? If they refuse to drop funding for the major banks, they can’t be paid again.\nSo yes, lobbyists need to begin spending more money to help banks and politicians who’ve failed the American people and taxpayers. If they don’t do that, the big banks and politicians will have even more success.\nBut they have a choice. If they don’t stay out of it, then the financial markets will collapse, that will be devastating, and that will result in a failure of the American economy. If they don’t step up and help bankers, then what’s left is another congressional blacklisting of DTC meetings.\nCongress may yet stumble. But the problem is just that a few days ago, the financial markets were blowing up. So far this year, there have been more than 250 charges against a member of Congress for lobbying for the banking industry during that time period, and over $8 million of that has been disclosed by outside spending groups since Jan. 1.

220,Trump Extends Social Distancing Guidelines Through End of April,"['President Donald Trump on Monday extended his 2020 Social Distancing Guidelines by five months, as an effort to reconcile the left-leaning movement he has led with those for decades.\nThe White House put the much-criticized guidelines through the end of January, just before the end of President Barack Obama’s term. He was set to extend them to April, at least.\nThe most notable aspect of the policy, which would ban non-white people from positions of power on college campuses, is an end to what many consider systemic racism. Trump has repeatedly cited the voluntary rules as an example of his foundation exerting control over political authority.\n“We will most certainly not continue to plan enforcement actions because they are already being implemented,” said Josh Marshall, the Trump Organization’s chief White House press secretary. “We do not believe that the removal of policies has taken into account the obligations of institutions whose institutions are at the forefront of overcoming systemic racism in our communities and in our society.”\nThe guidelines will create clearer standards of accountability for students for incidents of bias and discrimination, including classifying those under the direct or indirect influence of instructors and officials on campus. The White House said it hopes to get support for the guidelines from colleges and universities, but stressed that restricting the content of guidelines is a more pragmatic approach.\n“The accreditation standards prohibit unwarranted restrictions on engaging in certain expressive activities, whether publicly or in private,” Marshall said in a statement. “Fines and enforcement actions are part of that solution, but it is not part of the strategy of cutting out those rules altogether.”\nThe guidelines are set to expire July 1 and do not seem to be spurred by any major efforts to battle the regulations. Rep. Leonard Lance said the president was just exercising his Presidential powers over his Foundation and that the standards would likely not ever get approved before the middle of 2020.\n“It is his right. He can’t back down until the issue of college admissions for people with varying degrees of merit is resolved,” Lance told The Washington Post. “When I asked him for his opinion on whether he should or wouldn’t endorse his friends, he came back with a terse, tone-deaf answer.”\nTrump moved to soften and “clarify” his existing guidelines in the face of public pressure on his foundation. The changes were less dramatic than those for past administrations, such as Barack Obama’s standards and the Obama administration’s embrace of holding institutions to tougher standards.\nThe president’s actions have fallen behind administration efforts, such as the Obama administration’s self-imposed ban on presidential appointees in the naming and promotion of a new CEO for universities, or the introduction of a campus initiative that takes at least public criticism on board.\nThose actions, despite their broad criticisms, have failed to change college standards.\nTo provide evidence of the efficacy of such policies, scholars and advocates of academic freedom regularly found on Google Trends:\nUnfortunately, these methods do not necessarily apply to conservative (if multicultural) colleges, like Gramm-Leach-Bliley.\nAccording to a Pew Research Center study published last year, 47 percent of privately-assured (private) students said they believed no college should impose a heavy load on their educations, a considerable increase from the 57 percent who believed higher education should be limited to about 80 percent, the same percentages who said a lack of diversity was a problem, and only 27 percent who felt the same about the relative weight of a college’s Title I requirements.\nAttitudes toward the education-sector at large have shifted dramatically in recent years, but they still don’t seem to be helping too much: 56 percent of public school students who say that women and minorities are better at public school than white students are rated by the institutions by the National Assessment of Educational Progress as doing so well. Similarly, 35 percent of private high schools — about as many as all but 12 percent — say that black or Hispanic students are better at public education than their white peers.\n“There is so much to be positive about,” said Alexander Kuz, director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, in an interview. “But we cannot get the positive stories out unless we put more money into it.”\nIn an interview with The Associated Press last month, Kuz conceded that “odds are pretty good,” and some of the foundations will prove highly effective, if less than half of them receive overwhelming approval from their alumni, given the high rate of faculty turnover in the survey.\nPew’s survey, along with the Kennedy Center’s campaign against racial stereotyping, also found public support for some ideas. Several foundations have approved legislative efforts to “honor” critics']"

Unflinchingly, anyone who has met Trump knows the Treasury Secretary possesses no policy ideas. Further proof of that? Later this month, he tweeted, ""I want to tell all women that it is a disgrace that the President does not recognize their #respect.""\nFirst of all, he tried to land his most vocal critics in red state for cheap votes in the November 2016 election, even though he publicly challenged them: ""They\'s crazier than the Nazis!""\nTrump\'s proposal to bar women from having abortions also was simultaneously offered in Democratic-held Florida and a strategic battleground in Texas: ""It\'s ridiculous that women would not be able to provide this with their birth control, unless their husband is around.""\nAnd then there was the threat of war, a blatant affront to the concept of politics as art. But in the end, it was more tragic than political. It was barely measurable in the meaning of what the president was saying, but it did make a devastating, and yet critical, statement.\nIt\'s hard to imagine Trump getting away with anything worse than that.\n']"
222,"Liberty University Brings Back Its Students, and Coronavirus Fears, Too","['On Monday afternoon, students at Liberty University in Washington will find out just how many people have died of the Ebola virus, and their fears, thanks to a new collaboration between a local hospital and the region’s CDC. While most who got sick had been infected by the Ebola virus, some have contracted the virus through another way: through the University’s own student population, which has contributed to the University’s financial crisis.\nOn Monday, on a visit to Denver, CDC officials, students, and researchers from the CDC spent several hours, photographing and photographing the campus to learn about the unfortunate situation.\nPhotos by Sarah Jarosz Read more\nEarlier in the week, CDC officials and Syracuse University’s Health Sciences Center joined in to discuss the situation, saying that the outcome would determine whether or not the university would face a long-term funding problem, so it made sense to coordinate visits with local officials.\nThat discussion led to the announcement that Liberty, the sixth largest university in the United States, would be hosting its first international meeting with the Ebola virus. After the meeting, Liberty University principal Jim Hobson met with Vice President Susan Bison, SVP for Government Affairs Amy Lagule, Samuel Field, coordinator of the schools emergency response operations, Gavin Schilling, a staff physician, and chairman of the CDC’s Office of International Cooperation, and colleague Tom Marshall.\nDr. Hugh Curran, associate director of the HIV/AIDS division at the CDC, organized the meeting, the first one since last year’s Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n“I’m pleased to collaborate with this CDC-affiliated organization, this incredibly important program of research to fight this horrible disease,” Curran said at the press conference, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch.\n“Liberty University is our nation’s 22nd largest university, and I can only hope our shared community will keep us safe and our students and faculty safe. We won’t overstate the importance of this team effort, but we must put all that together in order to lead the effort.”\nThe Spanish National University spent several hours visiting Logan Medical Center, with Dr. Michael Nola later handing over the Ebola “victory” document. While it was careful to leave no trails of evidence of the virus, Curran said that it would be a “frivolous process” if Liberty’s FRC partners determined that the plant was infected.\nStudents took photos at Liberty University (Kirk Thomson/USA Today)\nMore background on the Ebola program:\nHurricanes which have flooded the country with deadly water epidemics created a “crisis,” widespread illness and a “crisis of survival,” according to CNN.\nThe Ebola virus infected 629 people in Liberia between January and February, and infected 492 people from Mexico between January and February, CNN reports.\nDr. Ahmed Hassan, who works at the emergency response program for refugees at Liberty, said that if the hospital encounters another Ebola outbreak similar to the one in Liberia, it would be a matter of “potentially” delaying treatment for the infected citizens.\n“We’re patient enough to handle this,” he said, according to CNN. “But it’s also precarious.”\n“If the hospital doesn’t treat more people, it means an increase in the number of cases and greater resources… If they do seek experimental treatments, we could almost say that we’re too sorry,” Hassan said.\nSince polio vaccinations started in 2001, two cases of polio have been identified in Liberia, Hormel Center has treated 960 travelers, and even the government has begun vaccination for 3,740 travelers.\nLiberia, which has become a model for school reform after the 2005 deaths of 3 students and five faculty members at a school where they worked at for years, is the first to officially confirm the government’s official diagnosis of the disease, according to Time.\n“Liberia is facing an enormous crisis,” UNICEF’s Dr. Nola said at the press conference. “When we talk about learning, we talk about fighting this disease. We talk about caring for children, respecting people’s rights and social cohesion, and we know that we have a lot of work ahead of us in addressing this crisis.”\n']"
223,The U.S.’s Slow Start to Coronavirus Testing: A Timeline,"['To understand why Dr. Sidney Wolfe, chairman and CEO of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, thinks the slow start in laboratory testing a vaccine for Coronavirus is an American improvement.\nProfessor Wolfe joined the Infectious Diseases Society of America nearly 50 years ago and has been working with clinicians in the developing world to help those from low and middle-income countries, especially the most vulnerable, worldwide.\nHe was one of my very first callers when the DU set out to try for Clostridium difficile (CDI) vaccine. Finding an RC vaccine was an endeavor with an eventual goal in mind but still slow progress due to financing constraints on finding new, common marketing methods.\nAs I first got my hands on Clostridium difficile (CDI) and its cause, it became clear that Dr. Wolfe’s enthusiasm for administering Clostridium difficile among the community could overcome academic and donor resistance with a federal grant of $21 million to expand its reach in the developing world.\nAfter a substantial donor match and money received, the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine purchased a $27.8 million R&D lab to conduct both the initial antibiotic and Clostridium Difficile (CDI) vaccines. The research was described in the media more than a decade ago.\nHe went on to post a blog website about their approach which has since morphed into a study titled “How the Local Small-Scale Infectious Disease Research Helps Innovative Tools Involved in Healthcare Advances such as Clostridium Difficile to Restore Clostridium bacteria capacity and Facility Size in Low-Overcome Poor Countries.”\nNow, 29 years after the initial funding, this team is working towards additional research funding, organization and improvement, in emerging areas of infectious disease.\n“The enthusiasm and momentum we are seeing from the pharmaceutical community and physicians in the developing world is a great boost. We’re incredibly grateful to the DU and the state of Pennsylvania for not waiting for a turn off.”\nThis group of devoted experts is exactly what is needed to test a new vaccine and, for the first time, to prove efficacy in lowering infections with solid TR0119 and TR0104.\n“This is the first time that we’ve been able to deliver solid TR0119, for example, without having to explain to the medical community how to achieve the current effectiveness of TR0104. From our tests, we know what TR0104 should look like for five to ten years.”\nTheir research team has not yet presented a vaccine to the general public, and uses a family of and newer drug a treatment, from new breakthrough drugs. They believe in pursuing TR0119 because it is so challenging to solve a disease and don’t find any of its big boosters.\nThey have successfully vaccinated approximately 500 people across different settings in 15 countries in Asia, Africa, South America, Latin America, Europe, the Asia Pacific, Western Europe, and Asia, including the Middle East, Africa, and the Middle East.\n“We are accelerating our efforts to discover when the right scientific, organizational, and clinical test are ready. As I have said several times, our projects are of enormous potential. We want to have best-in-class oncology scientists spread around the world – not just in developed world, but around the world as well.”\nMedical Research and Discovery Institute CEO David Bowman is quite clearly behind the organization in part as a result of the success story, but also as a result of the many and exciting developments, both monetary and in the community, at the Department of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n“The DBIA’s response to funding helped save approximately 240 lives in the U.S. between 2015 and 2016. The DBIA has achieved significant success in its current effort and plans to push further ahead with our senior leadership team as we continue to set the benchmark for the future of Infectious Diseases Institute.”\n“In addition to diagnosing infections, we’re moving aggressively to control disease. For example, most vaccines for HIV+ (or HIV 4 or HIV+ V8) are effective, but not all ERPs. Testing, for example, affects about 75% of those in severe or chronic health problems and results in reduced disease. Our medication for pneumonia and other infections that become airborne or injectable drug factor are also superior to other lifesaving treatments.”\n']"
224,The Lost Month: How a Failure to Test Blinded the U.S. to Covid-19,"[""File photo of President Donald Trump and Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan.\nCincinnati Bengals defensive end Danny Humphrey has retired.\nAccording to the Cincinnati Enquirer, Humphrey was given the green light by the team’s head coach before his contract expired on March 28, and told him he had presented a plan “for better practices and practices in regards to tackling and tackling the ball” and insisting that his insurance policies would be carried out.\nHumphrey was fortunate to have the chance to apply for a significant playing time. His final game will be played Sunday against the Cleveland Browns, as the Bengals finish their bye week. After dominating Cleveland on Sunday in each of his last two seasons in Cincinnati, Humphrey made the first and most important tackle in a 2-1 victory.\nRelated Cincy RB Spencer Ware ready to get into game action in place of Lathan 'Em Niu\nWith all that remaining in Humphrey’s life, it’s difficult to know why the Bengals brought him to Cincinnati. Maybe not due to the highly-publicized efforts of Coach Paul Brown or the quiet confidence paid in Humphrey’s abilities. Maybe it’s that the Bengals knew he’d be close to no games and HOF is predicated on that.\nPerhaps, it seems, the Bengals’ former defensive coordinator in Cincinnati was also a little on the cloud that had the group on edge. Perhaps that part of their organization was concerned that Humphrey would have the same status as Lathan Niu, since it would have been obvious that he wouldn’t be a willing bystander in a big game for the team.\nIf so, Humphrey had been eligible for the team’s Deflate-Gate scheme. Since it involved a violation of league rules by kicking the ball from the hole, the Bills were awarded what amounted to a grand total of 11 yards of first downs. Needless to say, Humphrey and his team then exited the game.\nRelated Ryan downs Wyoming, sees the positives in Nebraska, Stanford as big road wins\nEither way, Hue Jackson was impressed with Humphrey’s play. After adjusting to his role in the scheme, Humphrey promptly quickly broke out with some blocks. One of them came on a beautiful pass from Josh Allen, which was carried by Lamarcus Joyner. A game-winning field goal would have made the difference.\nHumphrey and Indianapolis offensive coordinator Jay Gruden worked well together in the game. Unfortunately, that might’ve created the impression that Humphrey wasn’t being vocal in Denver. On multiple occasions in the game, Lamar Jackson posed the possibility of a potential pushback by Humphrey.\nRelated Plans for NFL’s 2017 First Quarter offense make sense despite some deflating play\nIf Humphrey could’ve been more vocal, there’s no way that coaches would have wanted to mess with his character.\nIs it to put themselves in the situation that HOF was caught up in? Possibly. It’s possible that if Humphrey’s team stayed focused and showed up, it wouldn’t have made much of a difference. Perhaps the Bengals’ defensive coordinator and entire front seven would’ve had a quiet stop if it hadn’t been for the final play of the game, sending the team on their bye. Or maybe they weren’t all that confident in Humphrey’s abilities to carry the team and use the football as the team’s postseason gameplan. Either way, there’s no denying Humphrey’s dedication to fixing something positive in Cincinnati.\n""]"

226,"Trump to Issue Travel Advisory for N.Y. Region, Backing Off Quarantine Threat","['To rid the Island of his disapproval, President Donald Trump is to seek out city and county governments to say “yes” to all airports’ next steps. The move, prompted by the USO evacuation of the island – which is 26 miles from The Dutchess – was quickly approved by the boards of each county. Now, it must be added, as to protect President Trump and his administration, not to mention, the president himself.\nAccording to Trump’s office, over the weekend, Trump notified the Town of Rockland County, New York, that he had issued an advisory of the possibility of flying in or out of it to protect the union-busting communist city. That meant, instead of inviting NATO and even supporting the dictator-in-chief’s despicable North Korean move to declare it a “sunset,” Trump has now ratcheted up a diplomatic attack.\nThe NYSE’s president for a day, Thomas Brodzinsky, stated of the confusion over whether local governments can ignore Trump’s order: “I think that’s a serious, serious mistake that he should’ve taken,” Brodzinsky added. “The 10 minute rule, 10, is a lot of wait time for airports and so forth.”\nIn many cases, government officials request airport notifications on a point-by-point basis as long as the former does not happen. But why bother after all, considering the safety precautions that all of your U.S. Homeland Security offices have to offer? Furthermore, even with the aforementioned letter, the n.y.gov website provides a placeholder that attempts to “undo” a sign-up page, for instance.\nTrump has identified protecting the sanctity of The Dutchess as a priority, even when that goal is met. “It’s not going to go away,” he told reporters on Monday. “They’re saying they don’t need it and don’t want it, period. It has nothing to do with protecting America. It’s just protecting its national security.”\n']"

Frieden says that there have been about 6,000 pregnant women in the United States who had babies born with the small bodies of babies within the first six months of their lives, according to Reuters. The group of pregnant women have had to undergo surgery, which can lead to fetal and/or brain damage.\nAs such, Frieden says that during the current three months in the U.S., the worldwide rate of microcephaly has increased significantly.\nGawker is reporting that the 2017-2018 CDC report used 2016 data from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a leading biomedical research agency. The BiDA has kept a unit to take reports about microcephaly for at least three years, the website details.\nMicrocephaly can be a rare condition caused by serious bacterial infections that cause a baby\'s skull and brain to completely stop growing.\nIt is believed that microcephaly may be a carrier for Zika, which was first detected in Brazil this year. The virus is transmitted by mosquito bites and can spread from person to person to children, pregnant women and the elderly.\nDozens of studies in the United States suggest that microcephaly is a pre-existing condition and could play a role in heart disease and other diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nAccording to ABC News, the infection could set off a flood of unplanned pregnancies in a large number of people, including those that were found to have microcephaly.\nAlthough Zika has been linked to babies born with microcephaly in some U.S. states, Dutch officials have said Zika can have no impact on the babies they look at.\n""We don\'t know what causes Zika virus.

229,‘We are Trying to Protect Our Own’: The Towns Keeping Part-Timers Out,"['—As millions of drivers and passengers travel through their everyday lives on our highways, it’s a constant worry that cars end up causing road accidents. While nearly half of fatal vehicle crashes – (45 percent) – are caused by non-responsive cars, over 90 percent of those collisions are caused by cars distracted or unable to notice an emergency, according to a report by the University of Wisconsin. The paper’s authors are hoping the practice of using automated lane closures will help curb those who try to turn in front of a vehicle to an emergency. “We need some simple rules,” said study author Vivian Firash, who co-authored the study with Richard Chai, a professor of automotive and ergonomics at the University of Wisconsin. “If you have a problem and you are doing these lane closures, if you are not careful and you’re not slowing down, you can end up creating the worst case scenario in terms of traffic collision losses.” Among the things that could happen if automated lane closures become a reality are massive tailgating increases on the roads, impeding speeds and causing crashes. In these situations, “neighborhoods could have a lot of potential points of interest,” Firash said. But, he added, “The goal is not to maximize the roadway lanes you can’t pass” – but to create lanes that allow for every possible traffic block to be blocked. “People will see that now and they’ll wonder how to improve their road conditions so they won’t end up on the road as a result,” Firash said.\n']"

He is an academic from Dresden, Germany, and has been well-known online since he started studying at the University of North Rhine-Westphalia in 2010.\nOn October 12, 2001, Westward Journey targeted computer files and ordered attackers to click on the access request screen of a web portal promoting a web knowledge program for Russian users. This received around 30,000 clicks.\n“It was a violent attack. They came fast and furious. They started running through my files and deleted my most trusted contacts,” Safwan told CNN.\nThe virus, whose creators exploited a Chinese antivirus company, linked to websites viewed by some third-party organizations that provide social security data and threats lists. It proved significant for several reasons, Safwan said.\nThe company was the domain name of the hackers and had created the Webroot exploit, Safwan said.\nAll the websites Safwan visited were public repositories of security information.\nThe security software’s domain name was modified in 2011 and modified in 2014 for account protection. Safwan said the malicious software, which started as the Ukrainian weapons program East2West.org, had been modified in 2016.\n“The most important question is why do the cyberattack targets Russian-related information and the third-party search engine that provides business information,” he said.\nA start-up called Attack43 launched an online campaign in 2014 to get U.S. and Canadian businesses to sign up to the Webroot vulnerability. Afterward, the company raised $1.8 million, according to screenshots submitted by Safwan.\nThe company has since raised $1.2 million from investors including Marc Andreessen, Nicholas Negroponte, Jacob Stanchfield, and Kevin Martin, who was an early investor at Google.

Patrick Kennedy, director of the health and public health agency, told the Independent Newspaper that the findings indicate that the new wave of flu outbreaks continues to hinder efforts to combat the disease.\n“All of that money has just been wasted, and there has been a great lack of science in terms of what’s going on in the country,” he said. “Now, again, the efforts we are going to have to push forward are only going to get better, not better.”\nHowever, Kennedy said an equal number of the projects — roughly 100 — that have been “stripped of their design” would be put on hold without additional funding, as announced by the Obama administration.\n“It’s something that got done that even I called for, and we should not put it on hold,” he said.\nWhile those proposed cuts are likely to benefit the already weak state of the flu vaccine program and given the U.S. experience with increases in flu vaccine supply, they are likely to go against what many observers think are some red flags the country should be focusing on, especially when it comes to purchasing essential drugs from a more affordable price.\nU.S. pediatricians have repeatedly recommended that the vaccines be manufactured locally as well, but those guidelines have not been enforced. According to the United Nations, measles is a disease of the tropical sub-tropical zone that continues to grow, causing victims more severe illness over the next decade and causing 100,000 deaths in the U.S. each year. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that there are more than 2 million infected children in the world, and between 1.6 million and 3.8 million people suffer from the disease.\nSigns of flu that have spread into countries such as Saudi Arabia have been noticed in the United States, reports Reuters. Previous deadly pandemics occurred in China and Asia, and then in the past 15 years, according to federal estimates, more than 100 times the original pandemic which killed millions and infected over 2 million people globally. In the past decade, some estimates put the number of affected countries to be as high as 14 million people.\nDespite the risk of flu, researchers say they will continue to discourage people from purchasing new flu vaccines because of the low effectiveness of most of them. According to the World Health Organization, the U.S. vaccines in recent years have been far less effective than those in other countries, with no statistically significant reductions in flu cases. Some U.S. countries recently granted waivers to receive needed CDC approval to import hundreds of thousands of VX-based flu vaccine sets. Many have gone on to deliver vaccines to government departments around the world, where as cases have declined, some have become more severe.\nStriking the right balance between safeguarding public health and the health of children, the study cites the increased emphasis on vaccinations as a priority, but also concerns the the lack of scientific consensus that should be placed on that commitment.\n“We are skeptical that the key cause of the epidemic is simply the right education of children to be vaccinated against influenza,” Kennedy said. “But this study suggests that vaccines are important to ensuring that children are protected from pandemics. And that we also care about research and are committed to assisting development.”\nObama used the flu crisis as an opportunity to raise awareness about how important it is to protect children’s health.\n']"
234,Analyzing the Patterns in Trump’s Falsehoods About Coronavirus,"['Yesterday, in a press conference, the White House released an updated version of President Trump’s false comments about Coronavirus, which were supposed to affect Guam and Everglades national parks. This included the revelation that “countless” people in the media have reported that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had predicted that “normal to extreme” levels of microcephaly could have been expected in this population.\nHowever, in a review of the claims, including the current administration’s assertion that “68% of Puerto Ricans are estimated to have had microcephaly,” the concept seems too many times. Maybe the mistake with deception is not that different from the green light to state bans on imported alcohol or in doing what the scientific community was supposed to do to make it sound as if you were rationing.\nFamilies and cities across this country are now desperately trying to figure out how to solve this preventable problem. The New York Times’ response to this piece concluded:\nIt is too early to draw conclusions about the causes and effects of Zika virus outbreaks here, said Dr. Kathrine McClure, the Health and Human Services nominee to lead the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “There are unanticipated and unanticipated interventions that take decades,” McClure said. But what really matters is how fully prepared and equipped coastal communities are to prepare. And public health officials will have to do much more to reach that goal.\nThere is some evidence to suggest this is occurring, specifically in Miami.\nAnd in North Carolina.\n“We have seen birth defects, such as congenital anomalies, that can persist in a very young population,” Dr. Laura Niederhoffer, who directs Duke University’s Center for Family and Child Health at Duke University, told the Charlotte Observer. A study published in Nature Biology in March, with results published in Gaston Papers, found that the risk of congenital blindness and congenital appendicitis in the baby colonies at North Carolina were rising. But so far in South Carolina, few of the babies in the study have been diagnosed with any negative birth defect.\nIt will be interesting to see how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which knows this problem intimately, will respond to this new information. Once again, I’m sure that there will be some blowback from the press if there is any information that confounds their conclusion, but at least they won’t play the blame game.\n']"
235,"For Dr. Deborah Birx, Urging Calm Has Come With Heavy Criticism","['The August 2019 Ad Age Small Business Risk & Insurance Conference brought good news for the insurance industry. A renewed focus on shortening the costs of managing the insurance industry while developing new products offers the best evidence of moving the industry forward.\nUnfortunately, following the publication of the Space Herald blog, it seems that both Congress and the Federal Reserve have come out ahead of the markets with a year’s worth of uncertainty. While failing to understand the actual economic situation, sometimes taking responsibility for the specific tax measures, and attention to the underlying complex issues, Congress and the Federal Reserve continue to juggle conflicting conclusions and opinions.\nWhile there have been several reports released showing the amount of uncertainty in the market, especially with respect to new product launches, Congress and the Federal Reserve both appear to have zero responsibility for these changes. The Federal Reserve seems to have tried to push through policies and policies intended to secure and retain its members’ trust and confidence as much as possible. While Congress has taken the necessary measures to prevent Armageddon, the nation continues to struggle through what is known as the Fiscal Cliff. It is true that there are new uncertainties regarding all sides of the fiscal cliff and it is fair to presume that the Federal Reserve would want to buy treasuries and its bonds just to boost the economy. However, it was the Federal Reserve that encouraged the crash in housing in the recession of 2011. With the Federal Reserve looking down the barrel of large federal budget deficits that would be long lasting, it was the Federal Reserve that was prepared to respond to it.\nCongress has gotten the benefit of tightening its monetary policy over the last eight years as the economy has begun to recover and that is good news, but if Congress and the Federal Reserve want to move forward now, it should focus on being able to keep the current level of deficits in check. To be sure, the Federal Reserve provides liquidity to the markets and property markets. While the Fed did position itself to help prevent the Great Recession and their actions have been exceedingly limited and driven by the market, some would argue that the Fed stands on solid ground by lowering its benchmark interest rate to a negative 0.25 percent, forcing all sorts of policies on a massive scale that have nothing to do with the economy.\nCurrently, the negative interest rate is pressuring mortgage rates as they reflect the desire for home sales to move up and this economic activity has generated demand in a way that is unnerving to the market and keeping them in check. The Federal Reserve has not laid out specifics for the future of its rate increases, but the expectation of an inflation premium remains. While higher interest rates attract more people to the market, as the price of gasoline has increased, the demand for commodities has diminished as well. Those of us who live in other states that don’t have deflation have probably watched average prices go down by the double digits this year in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana. While such an apparent competitive environment may force people to re-consider their investments, it shouldn’t, at least not yet.\nWhile many participants believe the Federal Reserve is steering the economy in the wrong direction, it would be very wise if the Federal Reserve would focus on times like these and help ensure the current level of deficits in the future. As said, Congress should work through the impasse.\nDr. Deborah Birx is an economist and analyst with Ernst & Young who focuses on the financial services industry in North America.\n']"

No foul play was suspected.\nThe clinic remains in the hands of police, whose investigation hasn’t been completed and are awaiting fingerprints from two of the victims and a new autopsy — one still pending.\nPolice are also waiting to hear from about 20 suicide-residents in its next week to come forward with complaints that some from outside the facility have visited its torture chambers, another day after a supposed hijack reportedly took place.\nThe health department and patient registrar, Steve Petrowski, have suspended inspection of the practice, said spokeswoman Scott.\nHancock had no criminal record when she began the medication she was given after June 2010. She was on medication for an onset of hormone deficiency and had few known health problems before the suicide.\nHancock’s case isn’t unique to suicide victims.\nAuthorities have said one man who died at the facility’s practice came into a kidney bank, and five others from that incident have contacted death advocates at the Catan law firm.\nAssociated Press writer Danny Schechter in Adelaide, South Australia, contributed to this report.\n']"
237,"Coronavirus Live Updates: Trump Extends Social Distancing Guidelines to April 30 as U.S. Cases Top 135,000","[""The U.S. Health Department released new updates on Wednesday to its long-standing social Distancing Guidelines for organ transplants, after higher than expected complaints from organ donors and skeptics.\nThe updated guidelines require patients to undergo a double mastectomy or mastectomy with sutures or nasal implants as part of a healthy recipient's lifestyle.\n“If they consider this transition an emergency, this is the time to do so,” said Dr. Carol Phillips, director of the National Institute on Aging, where the guidelines were developed for the first time.\nSince the request was made by the Obama administration after a fatal gastrointestinal infection in a Florida transplant donor was linked to an infection of the same bacteria that killed an Arizona doctor, organs have been put back on people's plates with transplants for about a year.\nThe newly updated guidelines are only a beginning for the U.S. medical center for liver transplants.\nThe CDC, in its monthly report, said any additional stages on these patients' timetable could be a short-term delay, forcing physicians to shift patients into far more invasive surgical procedures such as resection of the intestines.\nCatherine Gleason, a senior fellow at The Leapfrog Group, a Boston-based advocacy group, said it was a clear trend that those patients, ages 19 to 64, would not be receptive to surgery again.\n“People are very, very clear that, in this case, they’re going to wait until their late 20s and 30s and 20s,” she said.\nIf the patient is a high-risk non-Hispanic white woman with lung cancer, she will continue to provide information for the CDC until October, Gleason said.\nIn 2013, a woman died after moving her intestines to a new place. The CDC found that her case was the first of its kind with a death from a disease caused by bacteria.\nThe challenge is going to be growing organ donation in the United States, as 20 million Americans give away their organs each year, Phillips said.\n“People recognize that it’s time for transplantation, it’s time for organ donation,” Phillips said.\nThe number of organ transplants is projected to grow to 82,000 by 2050, according to the CDC. That’s up almost 4 percent annually for the next 35 years, Phillips said.\nAlso, the number of acute menial labor projects fell, one study has found.\nMeanwhile, a third of people who are diagnosed with an annual menial labor project are in intensive care units, which may increase an organ donor's risk of infection if they experience at least a 15 percent risk of infection, the CDC said.\nThe CDC is yet to determine whether there are sufficient reasons to halt the training required for the waiver, said Colleen Avallé, an associate professor of medicine at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.\n“We need to be getting enough guidelines. We need to be getting the programs we need to support them,” Avallé said.\n""]"
238,Coronavirus May Add Billions to the Nation’s Health Care Bill,"['They may be as deadly as the Crohn’s disease, but their name is Bill-Strike (click here for Google Maps) — the star of the annual bipartisan health care bill — could actually kill its authors. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was to announce the first tier of proposed preliminary data about Bill-Strike last week. They have suggested Bill-Strike could be on its way out by February 2020.\nBill-Strike, formally known as pertussis, was first announced in January by House Republicans seeking to be included in the health care bill. It was named after the deadly bacterial disease that causes one in five babies to have moderate to severe viral infections.\nThe disease’s deadliest class, which usually causes no symptoms, and is more common in women over the age of 25, is currently infecting a disproportionately small number of children and young adults.\nBefore passing the final version of the bill last week, John Conyers proposed an obscure provision requiring insurance companies to begin capping coverage of children and older adults under the age of 2 who are causing the infections.\nThat provision, known as “obesity,” passed the chamber’s Energy and Commerce Committee during their morning debate.\nWhile medical professionals disagree on what constitutes “obesity,” Conyers made it clear they wanted to study ways to do so.\nAt the CDC, Dr. Carlos Garcia (who serves as the head of the Institute of Medicine), explained that the new bill is a set of recommendations, and while the proposal meets two objectives, it still falls short of what the House Democrats had set for a bill.\nThe two health care researchers used to be together before this, but now the two have begun jointly trying to see if Bill-Strike can help or harm the average U.S. population.\nThe Republicans reportedly aren’t convinced that Bill-Strike will be affected by its passage; no one told the CDC to limit its numbers. The House Democrats say they will look to see if Bill-Strike can help.\nThe House passed a bipartisan plan in early February that emphasized preventing access to certain types of health insurance for children and healthy adults. The measure now heads to the Senate for consideration, with a projected vote in just weeks.\n']"

240,More Americans Should Probably Wear Masks for Protection,"['I am a woman of many beliefs, particularly relating to my toenails, but I\'m also a believer in them.\nHowever, I don\'t fit into the category that I am coming off, much less one that I would call ""flexible.""\nMy favorite would be a boating outfit that I can wear just about anywhere at any time while comfortably in the water and without sacrificing my general safeness.\nBut when it comes to bathing suits, it seems much easier for women of all ages to get to a set pretty tight.\nHowever, since our lazy (and dull) legs don\'t take much on board in many diving conditions, it\'s definitely worth a little extra on the balance of your reeled-in boot. In fact, I\'m thinking of pairing a mix of water and a scuba breath and, since the best part is only about one-tenth of an inch of depth, I think it would be most likely to work.\nIt\'s really around this point in life where you wonder whether you are going to have to throw in a chair for your swimsuit and drop your underwear off every once in a while.\nUnless you\'re about to leave the pool and am worried about wiping out your broken paws, the more we gird for our health, our sexual function, and our sanity as a whole, the easier it is to be naked.\nExcept when you\'re too tired to dance, anyway.\nSince modern-day-rules such as consuming every type of liquids we can find make for a distracting wardrobe, I am mostly looking at these toenails in the shade as a safety precaution.\nThere are several ways to make your bottom a bit more comfortable, but that\'s a fact of life for me anyway.\nFirst, downsize your essentials. There are things to have in your boat that will make you smile to life, but also suggests that you sleep rough (i.e., bathroom-bus spray foam) and pull outside in a way that may help get the kind of do you need to have fun.\nSecond, remember that you don\'t need to wear any of the other things I saw in the ocean last week, because there were many. They are all important.\nThird, do not fret about not knowing when you\'re about to go out, because it is hard to set your mind right. It means that you need to assume that you are going to make your own choices about whether to catch the ocean or to your blog if it looks too great to even get a car in on.\nFinally, don\'t worry about purchasing your own skimmer. Last resort, say you use a one-year/one-purchase trade-in or a one-year/one-dollar price-tag for a regular price on the brand you want.\nExcept, of course, if you do have a log-in, you will need to know exactly where and what you are going with your skimmer.\nAnd if you have, you can bring your umbrella and umbrella cams to work, too. That $7.50 apiece is $1 more than just a reasonably priced ski tag or covered ski scrubs.\nI mean, who knows, maybe you could add, and I\'ll never quite figure out where and how you want to sign up for the books.\nFor most people, their first language is Spanish. But have you ever been told in the past by a teacher that one day the students from the Meuer language class in Nottingham may want to ask the secretary to sign up for a Spanish class?\nWell, of course, no, that class is a going-away swimsuit class, and Spanish is far better than English at teaching the students.\nHowever, you can come up with a pretty realistic proposal: When they ask you if you plan to go out on the water, I\'ll help them in other ways.\nLike, say, a couple of hours before you go. Will you buy a tan shaver? Like, ask the first couple of months to maybe shell out for an umbrella, too?\nOr the house they\'re going to move into?

241,The Lost Month: How a Failure to Test Blinded the U.S. to Covid-19,"['You’ve been visiting Southern California for the last six months or so, enjoying a weekend of housework, relaxation, sunlight and — welcome to the Golden State — an opportunity to just chill and relax.\nBut this hasn’t come about as enthusiastically as you might have imagined, because a mere month ago, at the Santa Monica Pier, a swath of whales — both majestic and deadly, including five feline calves to our credit — collided with one another as Santa Monica’s leading free whale sanctuary closed its borders with other parks.\nFirst, the fault was in Central California. I first had trouble tracking the predatory mammals while I was out fishing — the whales were first spotted on St. George’s Shipyard Bay in L.A.’s scenic north side, where the fishing industry grew rapidly, left a shell of one to scatter in neighborhoods, and eventually, reopened its lines. I thought I was supposed to be at the museum’s popular whale keeper’s quarters, but once we jogged into the Marina Bay Sands, I noticed I wasn’t quite there.\nThen, I started feeling distress at the sheer novelty of the crowd, and I started feeling sick. Other urban mammals seemed to be active at the off-shore site, but how could they be while those other whales weren’t around? I felt the fear, my body and my soul bombarded with adrenaline like someone had been locked inside a crummy machine.\nThe seahorses and big whales were coming out of the San Jose Offshore Marine Sanctuary, but then one video shows the reverse. A feline calf sneaks out the side of the sanctuary, heads explode, and calves are about to swarm the walls into an iron cage. It turns out the animal in the cage was half-brother to the sperm whale, but I wasn’t sure which animal. Did I feel acutely ill when the sperm whale was shot? Yes, because I was under the impression it was a humpback, but it was close enough for a human to see what happened when, in the opposite direction, an aerial observer met the sperm whale with his vision. Apparently a person had lost eye vision, but this happened to the sperm whale’s own chickens, but I was still fearful.\nThe whales and the feline calf were leaving the sanctuary from their wooded homestead, but why was this nearly unknown at a time that wasn’t as obvious? On the very opposite side of the sanctuary were two wildlife estuaries: Norton Lake and Gunnery Point.\nGunnery Point is less than a mile from Norton Lake, one of the two sanctuaries. I’m not going to argue. But I had a long wait — I had been dreading going back to Norton Lake for the last four or five years, seeing the whale’s predatory behavior, comparing how I would know if I saw a whale or a hippo in the ditch, and was determined to find out.\n“If you eat egg whites, your lips are not open,” my subconscious told me.\nSomeone called and told me something wasn’t right.\n“Oz,” I declared, “I wouldn’t want to bet the farm if I saw a whale.”\nI called the Santa Monica Coast Guard, who called the San Francisco Bay Area Air Quality Management District. They don’t fly whales, but they regularly fly the whales into all kinds of private waters. When a whale arrives at the Coast Guard museum’s mortuary, Santa Monica can feel in need of a thorough thorough inspection of the species and the locals’ well-being. A weekend from now, having the whales in our waters will probably be a slightly different experience.\nAt first, I thought the whale just seemed abnormal, because I wasn’t sure it was really a humpback. But it was true — it was the birthing horn of a sperm whale, not a majestic male. I pointed to my body, and within two seconds, I did not feel ill. It was nice to be clean-shaven again, like anything else, but it was quite the trip.\nI got up, went back to the water, and figured, “Why did the whales bother to release me here?”\n“What is the problem?” I asked.\n“The great, hairy and sluggish quads have reduced the ability to buzz around their mothers,” Santa Monica beach supervisor Barbara Scott said, as she mentioned the beautiful white quads circling near the nursing pod. “Sometimes they get bored and sleepy; some leave their sound cues up as a jolt. When a whale comes in, they get a kick out of it.”\nI decided']"
242,"A Heart Attack? No, It Was the Coronavirus","['By Staff\nScientists are re-energizing new safety systems for aggressive cancer growths, by releasing tissue samples from inside a hole in the body.\nResearchers from the Ministry of Health believe that their new option would be the prevention of prolonged clinical chemotherapy treatment on humans, rather than on animals.\nThe French study estimates that as many as 8,000 cases of acute cardiac damage, known as neuritis for how fast the body reacts to cancer stem cells, occur annually.\nThe findings will be published on April 9 in the journal Clinical Review, and are based on detailed gene transfer data from the JAS Cancer Group clinical trial for the protection of elderly people.\nThe European Union also recently extended the deadline for reaching a progress assessment for the European Commission to obtain all data for patients and their families on the growth and development of cancer stem cells in humans.\nChina, led by the Ministry of Health, recently, announced that a new mechanism will be developed to prevent the growth of mature cancer cells.\nDeveloped specifically to treat advanced polyclinically advanced cancer cells including those from brain cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, carotid squamous cell carcinoma, and Burkitt’s lymphoma, this method would allow cancer stem cells to be produced faster and more accurately, faster.\n“The combination of revolutionary cellular production and the use of molecular techniques has been revolutionary since the advent of radiation therapy in the 1970s. In the last 15 years, however, there has been no universal labeling for this compound,” said Dr. Florius Bognatore, a cardiologist at University Hospital Asenu in Leipzig, Germany.\nCurrently, this type of cancer is treated with chemotherapy therapy, although it is also evaluated for possible complications. This type of chemotherapy is beneficial, as it limits growths from the brain and produces a faster rebound of the stem cells. But the products that use this therapy, such as MRI-guided radiotherapy or radiotherapy drugs, can also have serious side effects.\n“These findings will provide new information about the characteristics of which patients and their family members are most likely to be impacted. The mechanisms behind this should be investigated and published in scientific journals.”\nSince an earlier study of about 250 cancer patients at a Jewish Cancer Center in Belize, findings showed no difference in the progression rate of cancer on the basis of similar treatment status.\n“These findings (that tumour growths may be delayed) result from a study that enrolled very young subjects, and this team certainly expected that aggressive therapies would prompt aggressive treatments,” said Noam Guralnick, chief of the Roche Research Center to Prevent Cancer, Parithromycin and Burkitt’s lymphoma franchise at the JAS Cancer Group.\n“We knew from previous studies that there are some small-scale cancers, and we also know that we can do more to improve the effectiveness of tumour suppression and even new treatment options.”\n']"
243,‘The Other Option Is Death’: New York Starts Sharing of Ventilators,"['If you were searching for a new way to disable your Ventilators, the first thing you had to go over was the alphabet of which ones that are in use in the US.\nThat’s something you’d have to be quick to familiarize yourself with before you could find one to replace the devices, and I was glad that the first ones were appearing in early February.\nAlthough no official model or manufacturing plans were shown off during CES, the first units that kicked off the manufacturing of the devices were revealed a few days after that. They include a built-in (and check-in) control panel that can be located by its side to connect devices, and an Amperex compatibility feature that allows you to control the version of the hardware you want to use while the device is powered on.\nIf that isn’t enough to excite you, there’s also the option of changing the symbol on the device to a familiar, pressure-free grid. That’s not particularly well advertised since it only takes you two seconds to toggle on and off a one-tap “Vote.” And it means that instead of using an app to get notifications, you can activate your device through your phone’s display.\nThese are all examples of how it’s possible to run products for other companies without having to deal with someone else. That’s because they’re not on-the-go devices, either; you can still get updates for the ones you already own (or keep updates from a friend who currently uses the device).\nEverything is planned to be compatible with existing devices from Oracle, IBM, Epic Systems, Tekmabs, Aon and others. The devices are planned to all be available by the end of this year, and developers will be able to incorporate features and code from their existing apps for the devices that they currently own, too. In the coming year, your choice will depend on your overall personal or business experience, in addition to your degree of skill.\n']"
244,"With Meetings Banned, Millions Struggle to Stay Sober On Their Own","['Lynne Cassini/AFP/Getty Images\nOfficials have banned most places of exchange from allowing dozens of their participants to remain sober on their own, prompting scores of arguments on the City University of New York campus in the absence of benefits and legislation.\nThe City University of New York has been acting independently since the U.S. Justice Department filed its first antitrust lawsuit last week against University of Chicago on claims the school’s “offer was generally accepted” but that its postmaster general struck an unfavorable agreement, while at the same time making less than fair practices applicable to its service, according to Reuters. The DOJ revealed details of its preliminary findings Monday, arguing in the Supreme Court that “laws, regulations, and statutory laws applied equally to the University of Chicago and other nonprofit institutions in the same way,” compared with these suitors.\nThe case involved a 2015 contract between the bank’s late manager and the former United Bank of Chicago. The bank planned to have accepted more than $110 million in savings, creating conditions that allowed United to keep more than $250 million in client accounts. Under terms of the deal, United management had to temporarily curtail the work the bank was being paid for and cost the bank $60 million, which allowed the bank to move out of Chicago. The bank also brought in $60 million in new management.\nIn response to the DOJ’s accusations, representatives for United and other U.S. banking institutions gave in and said they would not make any payments to the bank until the DOJ’s findings and those findings were detailed.\nThe circumstances of the November 2016 settlement, which marked the first time the amount United eventually paid had been publicly announced, are the subject of many skeptical interpretations.\nSolomon Wurzer, a lawyer with Memorial DeGeneres & Brinson LLP, told Reuters the DOJ’s findings were “baseless” and that the terms of the 2015 contract were “vague, deliberate, and are without any basis.” He added that the allegations are making “rather egregious arguments,” and noting the low number of federal employees affected by the DOJ’s findings.\nThat question is especially important given the decision-making power of the institutions, which contend that individual federal officials intervened to create conditions that allowed United to leave Chicago and to keep its workers. After the deal’s completion, the U.S. bank lost millions of dollars in client accounts.\nJustice Department official Mark Schiele told the Daily Beast in November that the DOJ also thinks the deals “violated rules that apply to services that US banks provide, including TRICARE (Community Health Association) and account-driven premium products, and that they violated other relevant laws.”\nThe Justice Department released its preliminary findings on Monday, and in response, the university said it was taking steps to end the policies “as quickly as possible.” “[The] settlement finalized today puts an end to the challenging process of selecting, choosing, reviewing, and approving the best opportunities to do so for each applicant.\nDespite the DOJ findings, Cassini said in an email that if not for an outside threat, the university’s policies and procedures would be open to the full range of commercial interests and viewpoints on campus, “to all party managers and their offices, to the employees of USB in the same form, and to UBA itself.”\n']"

246,Gargling for Coronavirus? What Science Can Tell Us,"['Last week I was a bit sick of drinking wine and taking photos of my smartphone. It seemed like the perfect excuse to do it. But when I woke up I almost went dark. I’m still a little confused.\nRoughly 12 times per day in a real-life situation, I take photos of myself on a huge touchscreen or tablet screen, hoping I won’t jump in the middle of the road again. I often finish those shots before they’re mine by eating them.\nHowever, yet another time, I spend tens of thousands of dollars of Myalsky (a non-infectious disease) money per year pumping out panicked snapshots of my life. And my organs might be full by the time this unfortunate situation hits.\nAll my life, I’ve been a healthy, very caring person who sought out a private surgeon or clinic to treat ailments from many years ago. I’ve had a handful of surgeries, none of which have left me susceptible to viral illness.\nWhat helped my body transition from viral to viral? Better yet, improved hearing in some of the patients for up to 40 years. These days, I’m not saying much. However, I’m admitting this for the first time in my life: I’m Sick of Coronavirus. I’m Sick of Myself Alone, Other People.\nI use my smartphone as my primary screen. But in my sixtieth decade of travel, I have had only one term screen at home: my tablet, which was used by one of my two brothers and I went on to do drugs. It was a year ago now, I guess.\nA MicroNote/Digital Mag Image Source\nBefore I found out that I was Sick of Coronavirus, I wanted to find out what science had to say about this fluid filled with neurasthenia. As a glaucoma sufferer in the 60s, I found out that the effects of standard eye drops sent the nispaholic body down Ih-ab-ah-ib-a during my glaucoma course. I could only watch that.\nI don’t know why it’s such a funny job — I’m more interested in it if your organs are plugged into Ihsan, the genes that produce antibodies that control inflammation. This is especially unfortunate.\nHowever, the genetic link to infectious viruses is under investigation. I’m going to never get sick. But I can’t wait for new therapies. My kidney has been repaired and my immune system has stabilized. If anything, my cornea is stable. Yet, I have an infection.\nTo date, I have three rounds of four immunosuppressants. My second and third rounds would be good, but I haven’t got the consistency for them to work.\nI was feeding myself fruit and vegetables a month ago and during this month, it was more like a kale patch. And thank goodness it was a staple in my diet, but that’s only as good as the supplements (blend oils from salt, olive oil, sugars) I ate during the month.\nI don’t think I will have nearly as many bottles of scotch or rum. The Plus, a member of the Alliance for Myalsky, puts an extra weight on it in the mid-90s, but is currently contributing to its efforts to fight viral illnesses. I try not to take it for granted because I’ve worked so hard for it, and I do believe that a viral illness can be transmissible to other people. I just hope I don’t lose more than my chance of being ill.\nThe only thing left in me is my cell phone, which is more cluttered and unwieldy than it can be. While I’m at it, I won’t get sick anytime soon. I know I won’t be sick in the sun, though. So, what’s next? How many other mobile phones do I have?\nDon’t Believe The Science!\nHere are some of my most critical, if you’ve been diagnosed with chronic viral illness.

247,Instacart Shoppers Plan to Strike Over Coronavirus Protections,"['By Jim Miles\nCHICAGO, April 1 (Reuters) - Retailers will be closely watching this week\'s Consumer Price Index to see if the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rises and whether the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to hold off on any guidelines for removing Coronavirus (CVD) from the prescription drugs it serves customers.\nCVD is a bacteria that can cause diarrhea and bleeding after eating contaminated foods. People who take the treatment get diarrhea for three days and are then sent home without food and water, and can be very ill.\nAfter a number of food and drug makers halted use of the drug during the years prior to the outbreak, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) was put in place so drugs and medicine can be considered controlled substances. The FDA put in place the Centers for Disease Control to oversee the FDA\'s new prescription drug labeling rules for drug and food makers.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been conducting testing on thousands of Coronavirus patients in an effort to confirm if the A-Cas-II strain from CVD was the source of CVD infection. It\'s too early to say if they\'ll find any patients to test it for.\n""At this point, it\'s too early to speculate on, although we don\'t know as much as we thought before the epidemic took hold,"" said Dr. Anita Lewis, a lead author of the new CVD test results. ""I still expect this to take a long time to go out and evaluate.""\nCDC spokeswoman Heather Zoll said the CDC and HHS had received CVD cases weekly from February through July in the United States and approximately 50 percent of the cases reported have been CVD-infected. For the second year in a row, the rate was less than 2 percent.\nThe increase in cases and number of confirmed cases could give the FDA an additional resource to deploy to prepare the drugs and to evaluate the regulatory responses, said Elizabeth Evans, a CDC spokeswoman.\nThe FDA has several tools it can use to make sure drugs and medical services properly serve the public. That includes replacing air fresheners with different kinds of water; providing a diet that pre-dates the disease\'s emergence; and reducing the use of antibiotics if the patient becomes resistant.\n""People with high CVD symptoms are maybe even getting 1 or 2 vaccines, but there are ways they can fight a very serious illness that shouldn\'t happen to them,"" Evans said.\nA CDC spokeswoman said CDC researchers also are carrying out clinical tests to see if a pathogen contracted during CVD infection is the cause of the infection, but that the infection has spread far beyond the infected system. It remains unclear if there is a pathogen causing CVD infection.\n""Saying there are CVD cases is an interesting thing,"" she said. ""But at this point we have no evidence that CVD infection is a leading cause of CVD and the disease will continue to be a large public health problem.""\nIannetta Billabne, CEO of Auberge Auberge, which sells the antibiotic Clostridium difficile in only the U.S., said a recent uptick in CVD cases has come from people buying various CVD drugs.\n""People make offers to buy CVD for a price, and not have to worry about CVD if they get caught up in it,"" she said.\nInsurance firms take care of many of the common problems of patients who get CVD through their natural source of income, but uninsured patients are concerned about a higher price for CVD medications, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.\n""You know you can have an illness when there isn\'t enough insurance on the list,"" she said.\nThe CDC hopes to start taking public reports later this year of CVD symptoms, including those seen in people who are sick or when they get sick, she said. It may then require manufacturers to develop protocols for recognizing and reporting infections.\n(Reporting by Jim Miles; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Sandra Maler)\n']"
248,‘Women Will Not Be Forced to Be Alone When They Are Giving Birth’,"['By Sarah Hack\nEvidence is mounting that Drs. Naraghata, Nuala O’Connell and Arianna Huffington have an innate point of view about what happens when women give birth.\nThe phenomenon is really common and earlier a better understanding of it has opened up. The only time women might be the wrong ones to have a baby is when they undergo a heart procedure.\nBut based on recent research, it’s possible that many women who give birth to a child who came into their immediate circle of potential friends and support networks may not have a similar view.\nA US study of 1,000 women found that over 4% reported being the wrong woman or the wrong man for the baby; suggesting that much older women may be the more likely to give birth to a man with a gender that other men are in the path of, say, being against child labour or being good on family planning.\nA second US study found that women who used to think that men were better than women because of their sexuality couldn’t possibly be the same women.\nYummy mothers\nHealth experts are also calling for better research into whether a significant proportion of women giving birth are doing so because they are demonstrating the wrong way about what the baby ought to be brought in.\nIt is estimated that more than 70% of births are delayed in 40-60 years or more and statistics suggest only about 10% of births are delayed between conception and delivery.\nEducation is an important factor in dealing with these issues.\nResearch through IVF shows that up to 90% of newborn babies born out of wedlock are born with a damaged embryo, especially when the baby is in the second trimester of the pregnancy.\nThis belief must be tested, of course, in practice.\nOften, this is why almost two thirds of women having a baby with blood disorders are given false advice when they are told there is a girl left by her father.\nThis is especially true when the baby is taken from their parent before her 13th birthday and her first birthday.\nFurthermore, in pregnancy, miscarriages can occur even when the baby is in cot by 18 months.\nData shows that when the infant is pregnant, the baby’s reproductive tract, that’s called an embryo management tract (CATI), is not fertile.\nThis is highly improbable and is very disturbing.\nHow to repair it\nInstead of propping up the baby up with a syringe, kit for smashing down the baby in a way that’s no more safe than a nail, water is to be used.\nThis method has recently been shown to dramatically reduce miscarriage and babies do even better than the current system.\nWhen this method is used as a guide, every little girl and girl’s body can benefit from it.\nThe following is a short overview of the techniques used to repair the eggs after fertilisation:\nThe egg turns out to be mature and has no reproductive compound. This prevents miscarriage, births and deaths.\nThe egg takes months to fertilise, and produces no sperm.\nThe amount of sperm removed, the rate of fertilisation and any birth defects after fertilisation remain as small as we have seen in the past.\nThe egg is fairly stable when tested to maintain a chromosomal condition.\nYour egg must mature at least 6 months before pregnancy.\nIf you can’t reach a good maturity, by changing the egg we have in us – and we have in the moment – we are restricting you, now, to a generation.\n[top image via Google Maps]\n']"
249,Coronavirus Crisis Awakens a Sleeping Giant: China’s Youth,"['Security has begun to take a more nervous face in China’s disrupted travel and tourism from the China-specific world of declining populations. That includes cracks emerging in the memory in China’s search for positive change.\nYet, China’s travel press has been equally well received, at least in the western media, as the Country Guide and National Geographic magazine have once again hailed the country as an “energy hub” for bright minds. But travelers are also wondering if it’s time for China to “wake up” or turn things around.\nThe first article in China’s reliable VTech News on March 31 featured newspaper headline “China has universal support” that opined that the shift in travelers from industrialized countries like Korea to emerging economies like Brazil should help “the exportation of good agricultural commodities to China, particularly the agricultural development of China’s economically poor.”\nSecondly, the VTech article pointed out that Chinese travel and tourism are responsible for about 45% of the carbon emissions in the world.\nThe situation of Chinese travellers contrasts sharply with their American counterparts. Businesses like FedEx, UPS, and Caterpillar have all registered a strong positive response to travel to China.\nCheck out the post:\nHotels in India have embraced tourism as an alternative to sitting around the cash cow of electronic devices. (Wikipedia)\nLocal governments have even reinforced the principle of selling to tourists the value of their traditional products:\nCruises are\nHelped drive Chinese out of Russia to Europe. (Artnet)\nTravel through China is now free in all cities around the world. (ARTnet)\nChurches in cities are increasingly training Chinese on their services and cultural heritage, local government employees, and travel writers are providing content that could be adapted in Asia. (Artnet)\nOf course, when it comes to travel as a good expense the investment isn’t going to be comparable with improving business. In fact, it’s not going to have any real effect in the absence of good travel.\nMoreover, in a country where the entire population is under 40 years of age, there’s no reason that relatively few Chinese are willing to put in as much as several months. Still, millions of Chinese nationalities have grown up educated, but are still elderly and their relatives and parents who use their leisure time to travel are still provided with travel insurance.\nChina, just like any other developing country, is in the midst of a developing culture and has a rich culinary tradition, but apparently its consumption is largely unlikely to boost its economy. It’s also very unlikely that a credit expansion will boost Chinese airlines with the potential to, as it were, boost travel by more than a million fliers.\nNevertheless, China’s diversification into diverse sectors such as healthcare and groceries should greatly benefit both the government and travelers.\n']"
250,"In the Coronavirus Fight in Scandinavia, Sweden Stands Apart","['When Antarctica returns to winter over the next couple of years, the crowds for the whale-watching safaris that are the life of a cruise ship will be even bigger, with all the scenery on offer.\nSince the start of the ice age, this country has been marked by periodic winter changes to the island, often accompanied by massive spring flooding. To deal with the rigors of the ocean, each of these resorts have their own marine parks, an old-fashioned version of fortress-like sandcastle courts where young calves once vacationed.\nNo other area of Scandinavia has an ice-docked aquarium that brings classic Japanese exhibitions to life in the back of a boat. One has a fabulous take on the foodstuff created by an area of Arctic lava flows — a museum of ice-bound and frozen plates.\nOn at least half the blocks you see an aquarium that was left dormant decades ago but still attracts more visitors during winter months. Among the intriguing exhibits are the Netherlands’ Sonja and Kel, the fishermen’s whaling boats, and the Elks at the Battle of Hwy 80 (yes, this is a small checkpoint) to watch salmon and sea birds as the boats rip along in their final passages.\nIceDocks of the Arctic is particularly popular in the Highlands, where a few weeks ago something was mysteriously going on, said Arvo Rios, an ecologist and Norwegian who is studying the subject.\n“We’re having to start examining what the climate looks like from within,” he said. “We have to make more economic, biodiversity-rich discoveries and studies, like how much ice is too thin.”\nTheoretically, this might be enough to alter the climate, Rios said, which could change the nature of the fragile coastal habitats so likely to be affected in the future.\nIceDocks can be found in various locations —some as far away as Hawaii — and can travel down to different seas and sometimes within a few miles of each other. Fortunately, Piga Wajda, an expert on biodiversity, said this was the only place where ice restrictions were in place, and one where every area had the chance to recover their ice in some way or another.\nDwight Backen, a visitor specialist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said that without more ice, there may be less land for fish and other marine life. He also expressed concern about the lakes that would be seen from Antarctica to the east. They will be high enough to hold an entire massive pool of fish, so “then everything will go completely algosical,” he said.\nUnfortunately, some ice species aren’t well represented in the sea, he said. In some places, sea ice “uses so much more than ice in relation to the feed flows.”\nIceDocks host South-South educational events. One can rent an instrument to hear the glaciers melt and salt water to absorb. According to H-Ywest, an organization that specializes in southern coastal research, three classes of whale-watching boats can take between $40 to $75 and can be rented to three or four times a week. One course can get to 14 guests. The cost varies between $100 and $300.\nFollow @KTgt\n']"

I have a list of banned countries,” he said in a tweet Sunday evening.\nThe United States last year asked for a temporary halt on all but a handful of prohibited individuals from entering the country on visas. However, four countries exempted themselves, including the tiny U.S. community of Canada, where local officials block illegal immigrants.\nThe temporary ban, first set to take effect on Wednesday, covers several countries and Mexico, said Marlin Epps, a spokesman for the Homeland Security Department.\nTrump\'s first travel ban arrived late last year after nearly every country the nation had ruled had turned a blind eye. Federal agencies in Mexico, the United States, Canada, France, and Australia made the latter changes in response to immigrants entering the country.\nIn recent weeks, however, the ban has unnerved some analysts.\n“We should have had this protection earlier, and it’s still going to be a problem,” said Rev.

253,Has Coronavirus Affected Your Fertility Treatments? Tell Us Your Concerns.,"['By Tanya Lodderhose, Health and Hospital Editor\nClose\nWhen sperm is donated from the donor, there are no known pathogens to disrupt the egg donor’s lifestyle.\nMean sperm are therefore deposited in semen, and so if one is unsure about whether or not his sperm belongs to you, what tools are available to help with this?\nMost fertility treatments, including vaginal and testes, are effective, but unfortunately, there are some ongoing concerns. When sperm is given out to someone you are not familiar with, it can reveal some of the things that go wrong with the egg. If you have children, what tools do you need to consult?\nSperm donations can delay the birth of a baby, which would not be surprising.\nHowever, Sperm Donation shouldn’t be mistaken for “one-time” donation. Since sperm donation is a voluntary approach, if your blood sample is released after you donate, this will generally be stopped until you provide and confirm your results. Ideally, you should carry out a blood donor screening test and choose a non-contact donor to complete the process.\nThis test, which will tell you whether or not you are male or female, will also help in identifying potential sperm cells. Sperm can be then being transferred to donors – semen that has been previously donated will be followed for the next 12 months before getting return back to the donor.\nSeveral options exist:\n• Contraception is available\n• Delivery services are available (including sirtuin (safer or longer-lasting) direct injection)\n• Mitre or decomposition-containing sprays are being developed, with the aim of reducing the risk of infection.\n• Truvada also works by promising against contracting human papillomavirus (HPV) in the womb and preventing recurrent exposure to the virus, causing miscarriage.\nAnother option for possible infertility is simple-yet-effective vasectomy. Unlike E. coli, which can cause infertility, vasectomy ensures that you are not inhaling dangerous sperm into the wombs. This will save you from any complications, because you don’t inhale any more sperm.\nAs for Tia Toye, founder of Vegan World, which provides people with a vegan diet with the idea of vegan living, she is encouraging others to consider proactively giving up meat. “Human meat eaters have found that avocados taste wonderful as part of their diet,” Toye says.\nThe book Food: Songs for Lifestyle Satisfaction is a great book for people on a budget or looking for ways to incorporate some of the more healthful foods into their diet.\nWhy did women die of Tia Toye’s book?\nTia Toye says that Tia has shown that a breakthrough science on how genetics, estrogens and testosterone affect a person’s reproductive health is needed. There is an assumption that proteins in wheat or barley that women eat end up in a later reproductive period, so Tia is warning those women against all forms of eggs.\n“No matter what your income, those who thought you were trying to feed yourself could spend all day stacking eggs,” she explains.\nThere is little science about whether its possible to increase risk, however. This could potentially be just one disease or a number of diseases. Tia’s book is available for free download.\nTia has lost more than 75 pounds over the past 18 months, and recently visited Japan to donate to the International Holocaust Memorial in Japan.\nThe book is available for free to download for anyone as well as travel writers at Tia Toye.org\nFor information on Tia Toye’s book, call +33 (0)2 546-3359.\nFor updates on infertility please email tanya.leodderhose@h.rr.com or visit veganworld.us.\n']"
254,Shielding the Fetus From the Coronavirus,"['It may well be a titanic disease that could leave every woman, every man, every child on the planet by 2050 and leave them fighting for all of their bodies. At first glance, it looks like the world’s only billion-calorie burger.\nBut it’s actually a triple-play of tumor-fighting resources: a host of species, pathogens, reproductive pathways, and the whole assemblage of tissues that fuel tumor cells. Although in the past research has shown that a high number of species are healthy, the latest study shows that some have died. And those circumstances change every six years.\nCancer vaccines have proven that they work—particularly when these factors are combined, and they work off of molecular biology. It’s not just on tissues where high rates of tumor development occurred. But that research reveals something else.\nDuring the autopsy, scientists found more than 100 great-sized tissues that had died of sepsis, but also at a higher rate of heart attack, stroke, and cancer. The gastrointestinal tract was one of the forms that had survived, and of those, only 6 percent had experienced major illness.\nThat’s a death rate that is typical of a large intestine. Fatty stem cells (sarcassoids) can become cancerous when they are incubated in the digestive tract, causing cramps, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. If the cancerous stem cells are made healthy, they can be infectious, putting their costs much lower. For many decades, this protection didn’t come cheap, so research has focused on the problem of protecting intestinal functions instead of pandemics.\nResearch published earlier this year found that we know who it is—we know who it is—but what we don’t know is how to prevent it.\nThis research appears in the journal Nature Communications. And while stem cells have the same great-sized role in cancer transmission, they have far less potential, and thus haven’t been identified. The average lifespan of stem cells is 25 years, but some stem cells can take 30 years to develop.\nThis means that, whether or not stem cells progress to metastatic, juvenile, or adult tumors—and why these mutations often appear at early stages—they need not have any health benefits, even more likely than whether they will remain susceptible.\nAnd there is one report that examined only studies about the prevalence of the disease in nature. The study that researchers sent to the journal, Core Body Imaging (CPI-E), examined 80 samples from the entire population. In them, their scanning system performed a more than 1,500 machine-learning-based observation in several areas: the lidora microscope, the mammography machine, cell imaging, and the cell-cell census station. All of these study groups also had cancer, and while nine studies were split into dozens of groups, the results varied.\nNo one could have made the bigger picture work, but biology is just about to answer that question.\n']"
255,The Experience of Getting Tested for Coronavirus,"['Well, it’s a little late for expectant mothers. But all that foreknowledge is worth having – just about every survey confirms that a ticker counting machine inside your womb has long been used to predict the safety of a new person’s womb, since people take thousands of sexual reassignment treatments every year, who are born within the womb and pregnant.\nAccording to a recent study by Yale University, the Aspect Ambulatory and Matronums can be unreliable when looking for evidence of fetal development. Based on results of the 2016 study conducted by researchers at Harz University of Technology, the company behind the Internet Watch project, Samihtoshi decided to take the risks and test their core technology before it rolled out to schools: The MiniMAF Retroscope.\nIn the text below, you can read why this impressive ultrasound machine was so unlikely to work. If you have already checked the sample sizes out, you’ll be pleased.\nRelated Image Expand / Contract\nThe MiniMAF Retroscope was developed by leading products and companies such as HHENZA, makers of HDIR Plus care, who patented a fairly advanced ultrasound technology that captures ultrasound vibrations in an act of pain. Using ultrasound and electroencephalography technology, the device takes the still-in-the-mouth vibrations from inside the fetus and creates a static image to mirror the ultrasound waves on your uterus. Of course, the team discovered that if you were to replicate a normal uterus, you’d have to strip away all of the hormones you’d created for the fetus.\nNot so: Notable exceptions are the so-called spine or the weak pelvic area, as well as infants suffering from vomiting and blistering pains. Following their sequencing, however, Samihtoshi found that the projector didn’t differ from typical ultrasound machines because the method had the “niche placement,” meaning that it relied mostly on ultrasound pulses to produce detailed images in order to automatically predict the safety of newborns. With a few tweaks, you can feel very confident your baby is going to be safe.\nIn other words, although Samihtoshi could have been pleasantly surprised at your lab’s unconventional way of identifying fetal anatomy – a technique they’re calling Instant Focal Calculation (AI) — the researchers came away enthusiastic. More specifically, they found that ultrasound should be able to accurately be detected in all stages of development, from infancy to the first six months of pregnancy.\nNot only that, but how long it would take to get an ultrasound image is still a mystery. Considering the physical beauty of the devices (and the patents awarded by the company), it is hard to be snarky about the errors. But I do think as long as you’re one of those women currently taking old-fashioned ultrasound shots at pregnancy (at least in private), you probably won’t see any sexual abnormalities. And for people born the first time, they may find themselves teetering on the edge of a coma.\nBut for those of you waiting to have babies, the MiniMAF Retroscope sounds like a good bet. After all, if you have an incredibly robust womb around you that it always looks a bit like the inside of your womb, the Frigidaire ultrasound machines give you a good chance of still seeing the baby in the person you’re expecting. Go to waste.\nThe MiniMAF Retroscope is currently on sale for $US599.85 (as of March of this year), but you can pre-order it for $US299.99 now.

256,How Does the Coronavirus Compare With the Flu?,"['An article by Ian Finnegan raises an interesting question: Is the Coronavirus worse than the flu? And does this mean that we have a good idea of the virus and the way it is spread?\nThe Coronavirus means the transmission of the virus, but it is not quite as harmless as the other viruses that are in circulation – such as rabies and dengue.\nProfessor Adrian Gibson of the Trewet Institute, a partner in Pembrokeshire National Institute for Epidemiology and Society, says: “Our study found that the two most common viruses were our favorite. The two most contagious were Cairn influenza and Cheshire plaitedusca.”\nThe dispute over the effects of the two newly discovered viruses has triggered a frenzy in recent weeks over claims that it was the H1N1 virus that helped introduce the infection in 2009.\nIt has been reported that the new H1N1 flu had carried the toxin — used as a defence against influenza — of the Plaitedusca virus.\nThe new H1N1 has caused several deaths around the world, after officials identified it as the H2N1 strain, affecting an estimated 180 million people worldwide.\nIt is said to have weakened human immune systems, making it more resistant to flu, and could cause relatively mild or severe illness.\nEven the Cairn flu is different in its structure, consisting of not only the virus (of which 90 million people are believed to be infected) but also genetically modified “circuits”, with its name derived from a seal on the skull.\nIn 2013, the World Health Organisation deemed the H1N1 strain a pandemic because of the well-known pathogen spreading deadly diseases like H5N1 and the H1N1 strain of avian flu. This has led to a disastrous and unnecessary outbreak of the strain in the United States. The downgrading of the H1N1 strain to pandemic status was the result of legal challenges.\nIn a recent interview, Dr Brian Milburn with the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington DC responded to current concerns, reiterating that no new pandemic of the Middle East flu – called H5N1 – is being transmitted in the United States.\nHe continued: “While we have had no new outbreaks of H1N1 virus in the US, there are reports that there is a record number of cases – including nine in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, Kansas, and Georgia – in the last two weeks. The number of in-person cases, number of deaths and deaths, is very shocking, and the numbers are too disturbing to believe we have not seen it.”\nDespite Dr Silvio Rossi’s pessimism, he says that a decrease in the number of transmission cases would reduce them by 50 percent. It is possible that this was the result of healthcare professionals rushing to test the H1N1 strain’s effectiveness during the 2015 decline in flu cases.\nDr Barnstead believes the H2N1 and H5N1 viruses and treatments appear to be at least as effective to treat influenza as seasonal flu.\nHe says: “Right now, we have not yet seen any evidence that H2N1 is being vaccinated. There is too little time left to ensure that these viruses are fully eliminated.”\nStabroek News received a letter from some kind of UK vaccine manufacturer suggesting there could be a peak rise in imports this winter, even in the east, especially if a flu outbreak occurs in the UK in the first week of May.\nA representative said that “Roughly half of our importing countries require influenza vaccines.” He also advised that farmers should not stockpile any imported vaccine, because the disease often causes complications such as infection and secondary illness.\nDespite the well-documented side-effects of swine flu, Dr Dan Stubbs, an epidemiologist and flu specialist at the University of Manchester, says the healthcare professionals should take the precautionary approach and get vaccinated – which is much easier in the UK than it is in the US.\n“It is important for our patients to get their vaccine to prevent potential complications such as vaccine failure – most importantly, virus injuries and severe illness. All the numbers show that when influenza vaccine takes place they increase the chance of influenza infections in 2018 and 2019 compared to 2016.”\nSource: Coronavirus International\nChallenging Farther Variations\n']"
257,How to Flatten the Curve on Coronavirus,"['A new report from the British Medical Journal has apparently focused on how closely the outlook for the Virus explains why people are becoming more susceptible to the bug.\nTo learn more about the virus and the VIA/VIA virus trend, we asked our Medicare researchers to document how closely the bacterial infection, VIA-V, is becoming tracked. As of late 2018, 64 people in England were reported affected by the VIA bacterium, which can cause genital warts and other other infections such as severe diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, menstrual cramps, blurred vision, and kidney damage. At the time, which counts as a four-to-six case infection, it was considered a worst-case scenario. We asked our group of students, epidemiologists, virologists, and other “experts” to rank several strains of VIA at various high risk levels: Triple, Asperger, and Albina.\nEvery year about 2.3 million people worldwide suffer from flu or other flu-like symptoms. Worldwide, at least 2.3 million people die as a result of flu and infections, and all of that is done by VIA-V. While it is difficult to determine the molecular mechanism behind this severe response, the most recent study using VIA’s study for the virus finds that the body’s natural anti-viruses influence the immune response, primarily with VIA. For example, VIA-V—part of the family-building B-cell virus, known as EMB—is responsible for activating an immune response when used in genetically engineered mice. By studying B-cell activity in low-viral mice, we know the rapid expansion of the immune response. In addition, we’ve seen that the body’s immune response increases with VIA’s acquisition of antibodies—meaning VIA relies on antibodies to kill off the genetically engineered animals. This causes VIA to overreact against a specific protein in the tumour, causing damage to mice’s tissues. This behavior has a direct impact on the immune response caused by the invasion of G-ME, which is spread by the flu through the tongue or tongue-associated bloodstream (HSA) infection.\nCavities of VIA-V come across as variations of an unhealthy, growing virus. A simple mouth scanner could track that inflammation or its origins. There are only three virulent strains of the virus studied—VIA-A, VIA-Y, and VIA-V. According to the latest study from the BMJ, VIA-V for example affects the cells in the pelvis, genitals, and blood vessels, and specifically targets cells with IV infiltration. The other two VIA-V strains, B-cell and Andaxia, possess the opposite effect. B-cells penetrate the blood through its own shell. After their replication, VIA-V accumulates the DNA of these cells. Later in its life, the viral population decreases over time due to viral invasions.\nWe asked our group of survey researchers to see if VIA was linked to high-risk subtypes of infection like HSTV-Y (the most common exposure for individuals over 35) and b-cell infection (B-cell and subtype of VIA). They conducted a random analysis of 350 high-risk patients who had been diagnosed with or treated with VIA-V at least six months prior. Using the analysis of history of virus infections, they discovered that a minimum of 200 people around one person are at increased risk of entering the pembrolizumab pathway with VIA-V. Since people who were tested for the new virus had not suffered any transmission of G-ME symptoms, the presence of a B-cell version of the virus clearly came as a surprise.\n“VIA’s long-term effect on the innate immune system, which recognizes G-ME, may be one reason why people who are immune to VIA-V were at increased risk,” said Roland Lee, an epidemiologist in the School of Pathology at the University of Rochester Institute of Technology and the study’s first author. “This is the first time there has been reliable epidemiological evidence for the same phenomena.”\nTesting those samples to test the increased risk indicates a group of individuals that had long-term exposure with VIA were at increased risk in general and VIA-V infected individuals were at higher risk. Moreover, all mutations may be present to protect against specific diseases or microbes from being transferred to humans. However, we learned that patients who get VIA-V may also have inheritable mutations linked to viruses.\n']"

However, there\'s a powerful way that our creative soul and our culture can fill in the ""we want to read a book with dates"" and can work so far into the first trimester of a relationship, rather than waiting until after sex. If you\'re just a creative person, find this photo of Romeo and Juliet and find the ""aha"" moment where you find romance. You might be excited, but it could be very hard to find when not being inspired by the first seconds. If you\'re finding it hard to recognize when romantic sparks are not enough, seek the out-of-this-world wisdom of the older Romeo and Juliet.\nMaking love in this way never leaves you with that feverish enough energy to fall in love. It can be also very easy to write down how a date will take place and how to find out what to talk about, or it can take an individual moment to figure out how your love will feel. Hopefully, to have shared such an intimacy, people are also aware of how close you are to each other.\nKeep it cute and cute when you know it\'s really personal to you because it brings out the mystery and beautiful will in you. On these photos, we definitely give each other attention, even on night out. We happily spend so much of our lives together and celebrating what that means on a romantic night out.

260,The Babies Were Delivered. No One Realized the Mothers Had the Virus.,"['""Babies are being fated to perish somewhere as soon as they are born,"" Todd Burzynski, founder of the Alzheimer\'s Association, tells The Daily Meal.\nThe Department of Agriculture has released data indicating that the average U.S. child was born with a rare and potentially fatal neural device that prevents the brain from developing signs of Alzheimer\'s disease.\n""The number of babies born without aural experience due to cognitive disabilities,"" report Dr. Jon Irwin , director of the Alzheimer\'s Association\'s Center for Care, Behavior and Fetal Care, told The Daily Meal, ""is a small fraction of the total children born without an auditory experience due to end developmental delays (e.g., poor energy, poor brain development, limited ability to concentrate, or shortness of breath).""\nBurzynski is president of TRIK, a nonprofit that provides educational resources for pediatricians and professionals in the field. The organization makes use of a nasal spray to address sensory overload, while learning benefits from exposure to natural flavors like berries and peppers. ""Our parents never told us anything about dementia,"" Burzynski said in a press release. ""This is the first time we\'ve ever heard the baby\'s name: They don\'t recognize the word Alzheimer\'s or MLK, but they do, given a present that is actually special and very necessary to the child.""\nThe children were born in the early 1980s. The Alzheimer\'s Association notes that many children are born prematurely or leave homes that aren\'t feeling well, and that those that do make a poor transition from the childhood to adulthood. ""Even if parents are aware of the limits to their children\'s cognitive activities and lifestyles, there\'s still no proof to suggest those children have the underlying neurological problems -- whether the son is exhibiting symptoms of Alzheimer\'s disease or not,"" the organization notes.\nIf a baby has neuropsychiatric or developmental problems, some will roll over and die, according to Burzynski.\n""Depending on the degree of intellectual disabilities the child is experiencing, those with neuropsychiatric ailments may be unable to perform their entire cognitive activities,"" he said. ""What the children are having can lead to developmental delays."" In a dose-response scenario, a baby\'s nose and mouth can fill with oil as the baby sleeps or doesn\'t shut off when he is crying, for example. In a realization, the baby\'s brain implants a ""dry region that can develop into tissue types that assist in processing information.""\nThe baby\'s brain has only 100 nerve endings, the scientists estimated, and their ability to learn independently is limited. Studies suggest that these regions lack information throughout the body such as protein metabolism, DNA information and breathing, leading to an increase in disability, according to The Daily Meal. And the babies, with unexplained developmental delays, may need treatment as early as six months or longer.\n']"
261,Daily Aspirin Does Not Lower Alzheimer’s Risk,"['In a review of observational studies of the effectiveness of daily aspirin used in treating Alzheimer’s disease, published today in the journal Neurology, Medical News Today found that a daily dose of aspirin (available for over six months) significantly reduced the risk of Alzheimer’s and other diseases by at least three to five years.\nIn Alzheimer’s disease, the researchers found that daily doses of daily aspirin reduced the risk of Alzheimer’s in three different groups. The most frequent-dose patients had a 75 percent reduction in Alzheimer’s risk, while those who had a higher dose had a 20 percent reduction in the risk. The smallest group had a 12 percent reduction in the risk.\nIn Alzheimer’s disease, older adults can experience severe episodes of severe fatigue and potentially respond to mild cognitive impairment (CDI) through acts of other pre-existing symptoms, such as sudden, excessive thirst, and confusion. These symptoms frequently resurface, sometimes for decades, in adults whose cognitive ability has been impaired in the past.\nBy delaying or reducing daily doses of daily aspirin (as recommended by the World Health Organization), the researchers were able to predict the risk of Alzheimer’s disease by identifying an association among those in the highest level of reduced risk in the seventh group.\n“These studies provide important new information about the molecular impact of aspirin and their role in disease onset, as well as improve our understanding of the clinical causes of drug-related dementia and Alzheimer’s disease,” said lead author Hugo Isabelle Zeller, MD, PhD, a professor of neurology at Columbia University School of Medicine.\n“Thus, our results highlight that aspirin may have an important role in managing head and neck syndrome, among other conditions, and we hope to make future studies more rapid.”\nThe authors explain that they began working on aspirin usage in 1996 as a standardized laboratory test and felt that the range of genes that might influence a patient’s tolerance was not high enough for risk-based clinical studies. After several years of learning more about metabolism and the mechanisms of depression, the authors eventually decided to expand the study into more time-consuming, multiple-step studies, including the current one.\nTheir study is the first to show that daily aspirin can reduce the risk of dementia-related dementia during a patient’s treatment.\n“The main benefit that such aspirin can make of late Alzheimer’s disease by slowing down mild cognitive impairment,” said co-author Elisabeth Sacker, PhD, associate professor of general medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. “It is one of the most effective treatments ever for dementias, so it is truly remarkable that so little has been studied on this topic, and that such an important public health intervention is in such early stages.”\nThe authors say this study should serve as motivation for patients, caregivers, researchers and even policymakers in at least 30 countries around the world to slow the development of brain-damaging diseases such as Alzheimer’s and other neurological disorders.\nMNT & Urbana-Champaign (Illinois, Ill.)

262,Now Is the Time to Take Care of Your Lungs. Here’s How.,"['Let’s be honest: You want to do this, but you’re not sure what it means. Our lungs don’t start life feeling full to the core, and given what we’ve found so far in our fight to be healthy, the next breath in the equation can be a terrible event. Sometimes, your lungs can start shrinking and your lungs become malnourished.\nIt’s not an absolute thing, but there is a risk that the lungs will snap with age or explode. And what’s worse is if you’re healthy, your blood sugar or blood pressure are low. My colleagues and I are all over this struggle. Every month, a liver cancer patient can expect to run into trouble when new blood vessels begin breaking or causing redness in the outer ear. In some cases, nausea, dizziness, or stomach aches could occur. Plus, the embarrassing moment when a hard-to-understand condition threatens to leave you in the hospital might seem to be such a headache that even the doctors need some obvious guidance.\nSo what is Lung Disease, and what is Treatment?\nLung cancer is a brain disease where one causes various problems. Like some other type of cancer, you try to harness the blood to heal the body and become a purifier of healthy blood supply to the heart and muscles.\nYou may have had some lung cancer, but it remains a mystery how the deadly disease spreads. It’s an unpredictable disease that occurs as you lose skin or bone. Lung cancer is usually caused by inflate tubes in your lungs. Some people also have stomach or stomach cancer, and there are many cases of ear or throat cancer. The scarring comes from inflamed tissue. There are often complications with the recovery and cure of the disease if you’re a smoker, drink alcohol, or engage in risky behaviors to help your cancer go away.\nLung disease surgery is a well-meaning treatment. It’s an option, and patients often get a kick out of the fact that you might be treated for many cancers during your first few weeks in the hospital.\nThere are many kinds of lung cancer surgeries.\nMany make the death of lung tissue a reality. For example, there are a couple patients who are fighting cancer with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), which affects as many as 100,000 Americans a year. Lung cancer is typically the result of a tumor-forming cell spreading to the lungs. Lung cancer cells (who live in your blood) eventually infect their host, but they often live in damaged areas of the lungs.\nA decrease in your blood pressure could be what would trigger a kidney or pancreas transplant. You may have lost a significant portion of blood vessels, so if you were going to see a different doctor, then a different person might need your help. Using a blood draw like I did last week, I tried to make myself feel better with results the next day. So I asked the next doctor if it was worth his time and all he did was point out that he too was reluctant to get your blood pressure checked. Now if I’m having a cold tomorrow, I get a little hold of the blood pressure monitor and see what really matters: don’t want to make an appointment.\nLung cancer can and probably will be conquered. Today we are battling a disease that has a health effect that nobody else in this country is supposed to, and we should take advantage of it. There are steps that can be taken right now to help fight your lung cancer to find its way to your lungs.\nThe DTAs [W-ratings] and [Conversion] Are becoming increasingly problematic. In some cases, we might be able to go ahead and correct it, but others have proved impossible. As with any disease, the survival rate depends on some very simple factors, including the smoking rate of the smokers and the changes in heart rates during the disease phase.\nIf you’re concerned about getting lung cancer treatment, have a certified lung specialist go out on a limb and offer a free copy of Basic Actuarial Science 606: On Wednesdays until Dec. 6 in the CAN Memorial Hall, 910 Sixth Ave., NW.\nJulie O’Callaghan\n']"

Labour’s shadow chancellor John McDonnell wasn’t watching at the time.\nThe crash of Kensington Palace with 10 days left in the Tory leader’s second term in office sparked strong reaction from the firmest critics of the ex-policeman.\n“He’s off, absolutely,” John McDonnell said. “I mean every Tory leadership can be controlled by him – and they did it long before Boris Johnson was a Tory leader. He puts in place policies to cover up his failures.”\nHealth Secretary Michael Gove defended Johnson against critics of his policy. “I think this is extraordinary for the leader to conduct himself at the same time” as he does every other member of his party, Gove said.\nIt is a case that puts down to the fact Johnson has undertaken policy reform to stop his predecessor describing himself as a “slow death”.\nHuge cuts at Labour HQ on watch\nA senior Labour source said: “The PM’s office will now be expected to have an open and honest debate on whether Boris should be PM or not. It’s a saga of a crisis man and a crisis politician.\n“He’s been talking about this for the last couple of weeks, but he’s been outspoken about the Government’s poor health and vulnerable targets. It’s curious to see the mood of his party today.”\nLabour sources confirmed that chancellor Philip Hammond called Johnson a “stressful dog” and said the country had to wake up and smell the killer.\nHammond made a surprise appearance on Marr show and said the health minister had not followed the lead of his predecessor David Davis.\n“There is significant concern over the health of Boris Johnson – he is managing one of the toughest communications contracts in UK politics,” he said.\n“And if we thought this was going to be a short term bump or surprise for Boris Johnson, maybe why don’t we accept his guidance and respect it?\n“Someone has to look beyond it – I don’t think Boris is anti-democratic – and see the political consequences of not following his guidance.”\nAn unelected Cabinet minister has suggested the PM needs to resign, having taken “recent events” to secure the £250,000-a-week sum proposed by the PM’s health spokesman, Alistair Darling.\nJohnson has been under enormous pressure in the run-up to the EU summit.\nWhile claims of the prime minister an attack on his right-wing colleague in the past have been rife, the bitter summer is still running ahead, with Chancellor Philip Hammond set to unveil the commission’s proposed cuts to corporation tax, again this week.\n']"

To begin your trip, travelers should make sure you have a ventilator (specifically one for adults, naptimes up to 24 hours).\nAnother option would be to like your Ventilator more than the next occupant. Many sites offer educational or just general sessions on Ventilator-related topics, so you might also want to find something to write on or download, for example to type in your address. You don’t necessarily need to have a Ventilator System by then, but it’s pretty promising for your consumption.\nIf you are reading this on an old computer monitor, then you will be getting some sort of “comfort zone” and a fast walk through your local Ventilator store to stay satisfied. If you’re really looking for a big-screen experience, then you might want to look at the word “morning mode” on some Ventilator housing. You should certainly see some people checking in without using Ventilator.\nThings to do, however, aren’t inherently less comfortable for you when you get to the Ventilator than for someone in your home in something akin to plumbing, trash, or even food. If you have a Ventilator, your ventilator should be allowed to keep you entertained while you wait for you to board the car to get to the store and back to your Ventilator to go back for rest.\n']"
266,"The Virus Is Coming to Myanmar, but the Pain Has Already Begun","[""The outbreak of encephalitis in Myanmar has already been a hot topic in international news circles. The African nation, which is also the poster child for the deadly E.E. flu virus, had previously also seen the virus linked to spleen attacks. So much to everyone's point of view, the disease is also the most deadly of all tropical tropical diseases.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), a case of encephalitis in Myanmar had been observed earlier this year. Herpes Aids had spread rapidly across the country, causing about 12,000 cases and requiring 200,000 new cases over the last decade. The epidemic remained very active until last year when it struck north of the border, followed by a flare-up as a result of a high-profile related outbreak in the northern state of Chittagong in May, the week before Myanmar's elections.\nThe disease is severe enough to kill, but due to increasing severeness it still requires care at a relatively moderate rate, as well as access to treatment and life-saving equipment.\nLeading up to the outbreak, thousands of people had sought to flee, with many currently living in makeshift structures in remote villages. Meanwhile, Myanmar's own severely weakened economy has brought the government on board to take on this challenge, and perhaps a renewed awareness of the dangers that this the strain poses to the country.\nThis is the topic of discussion on TV's\nParticularly following the outbreak in Myanmar, the public health authorities in the country have the ability to quickly trace the virus, and have made health risk assessment work on them. They are working closely with government officials to create special teams to carry out an independent assessment.\nThis has been a source of contention for some time; covering the opposition, the religious parties and civil society all complained that the incident was highly politicized and could be interpreted as an attempt to foist the particular narrative of the October 10th debate, held in the streets of Ile Dae, home of major opposition party Asayin Aye. There was no attempt to cover up the incident. Nevertheless, reports of the drug-induced drug use were prominent across the country.\nWe received a couple of reports reporting the passing of the typical [drug-related] dose of [a] dose that is a two- to three-drug version of the AOMF. The levels of these doses might have been abnormally low compared to those that often occur in tropical or Asian countries, and who generally carry more serious E.E. flu viruses. This indicates that the AOMF spectrum offers a stronger chance of surviving the sickness, which is particularly true of tropical diseases, which have unusually high prevalence amongst very weak immunity groups.\nMultiple studies have documented the same risk effects of over-consuming a typical five- to six-drug dose in tropical populations, with significant health risks. According to WHO, the most common risk factors are the age, education, presence of a fever, frequency of close contact with neighbours, and normal water intake, which indicates a high susceptibility to contaminated land and water. This is really, really different from tropical diseases, where, before the standard of living changed from a few hours of light rainfall to a six- to seven-hour day.\nWhen the doctors gather themselves to assess the risk of complications after drinking medication, the only thing that is known is that they encounter the symptoms, and to knock them off the dose is to not be able to breathe. If the symptoms get worse, it is probable that these treatments can easily be reversed or saved up. While it does not directly affect the population, it is highly likely that these patients will make a larger contribution to fighting the epidemic, but for now the advice is to consume a very large dose of the drug immediately and wait for an acceptable outbreak. With much thought and resources, we hope this process will be able to produce much-needed medication for the epidemic quickly.\nThus, while this strain is clearly possible, it cannot be predicted and routinely monitored. Nevertheless, the government's response to this outbreak, which has proven itself to be effective in putting an end to the existing ineffective response, is now pivotal.\nThe final report of the coordinated operation by a team of highly-trained soldiers, public health authorities, professional and medical teams, and a national assessment team, coordinated by the WHO, was published on August 10th, in the medical journal WHO.\n""]"
267,"Trump Signs $2 Trillion Bill as U.S. Virus Cases Pass 100,000","['President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, April 1, 2018, in Washington. (Andrew Goldman/Reuters)\nThere’s a new epidemic under our administration, a new outbreak of multiple, multi-drug resistant Fikretos – a Mexican-made compound that grows in the urine of people exposed to the drug and is sent to Asia to fight it. The most notorious of these pathogens is the deadly pyrethroids – a wet, powdery, liquid substance with an odor that feeds on a body’s blood.\nFikretos can cause the loss of vital organs because it transfers a fat soluble substance to the lungs. After the underlying fibrous tissue of the body is modified to stop the element, it retains the chemical energy of the fikretos, a compound that has been linked to disease in dogs and mongooses.\nThere’s no indication that a new outbreak is emerging. But the incidence of Fikretos is increasing, at least among Mexicans, who are among the most vulnerable of the U.S. population. The number of Fikretos cases has reached almost 100,000 last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Several studies have found that the patient of the so-called border-crosser is 12 to 24 times more likely to have been exposed to the substance than people who have never had it.\nCDC said Monday that it will ask for a blanket ban on Fikretos within two years. Health advocates, who have used Fikretos to fight numerous diseases, welcomed the new prevention legislation, but vowed to wait for the Food and Drug Administration to approve the substance for use on food. Food companies also have argued that it will be used safely for animals that have not already developed their own resistance to Fikretos. A food safety study conducted in 1994 found Fikretos could cause a public health catastrophe.\nMaking Fikretos is “dangerous,” Mexican anthropologist Piz Guerrero told HuffPost, “but sometimes, that will help the problem.”\n']"
268,Early Graduation Could Send Medical Students to Virus Front Lines,"['In a move that could translate to promising therapies in medicine, a medical school will deploy a signal-borne vaccine that would send its graduates back to safety.\nGraduates of Duke Medical School will still receive medical school credits, but there will be no paperwork requirements for completing the courses.\nThe school has placed the pilot project in doors that students will enter once they graduate — not wait for an alert.\nThis week, scientists got a good look at a potentially devastating virus. It takes five days to transmit the Zika virus to a person, and it can cause serious birth defects like pregnancy, blindness and neurological damage.\nCardinal Timothy Dolan, professor of medicine at Duke and a co-author of the study published in the journal Nature Medicine, said the time to travel had faded in recent years.\n“Before the onset of the pandemic, we had a shortage of immunology and learning and research centers,” Dolan said in a statement. “Now we’re seeing a shortage of people ready to take on such an important role in medicine.”\nThe university plans to enroll about 1,000 medical students in the pilot program and have them appear before a committee for a future study. Those new medical school enrollees would graduate with an environmental background at the health college’s center for cancer, pharmacy, electrophysiology and neuroscience. That would require at least five years of advanced degrees from the university’s biomedical and medical school programs, one of the study’s authors says.\nThe program is meant to pair students with university programs. When testing is completed, with full Spanish in the final two years, next year’s freshman class will be the biggest yet.\n“I was interested in how much we could pay for our students to get on campus,” said Kevin Watts, a chemist at Duke and a co-author of the study. “But there are really different benefits for the university going forward.”\n“I actually read some papers on integration and for first-year students to have a relationship with universities,” Watts said. “That gives hope about that whole notion of universities as forward-thinking and progressive social institutions.”\nAt Duke, they will hold community outreach days through the fall to gauge the success of the pilot program. A chef from Six Flags Universal Orlando has come on board to deliver more elbow grease to the program.\nFour new universities, including North Carolina and South Carolina, have committed to getting some of their inventors and scientists onto medical school campuses.\nNew scientific institutions aren’t necessarily better off than predecessors. But they are setting ambitious goals that could lure talented researchers to develop cures for such diseases as carmines, cancer and AIDS. Many universities want to push programs that involved teaching or research, and to see them succeed.\n“The basic selling proposition is you can’t compete with Harvard or MIT,” said Navid Madar-Aider, an associate dean for medical education at North Carolina State University.\nThe fact that Duke has put itself up for grabs is clear. The medical school boasted of launching a campus to treat Ebola in 2014, and talked about expanding partnerships with universities to boost a flu vaccine system earlier this year. After Fukushima and Chernobyl, after earthquake and tsunami, a struggling economy, especially within the Northeast, depressed the medical school, which had at one time held its first annual graduation event.\nUp until now, the school’s program was very limited, says the editor of its website. Many students were already familiar with the school, and are eager to discuss with their parents.\n“It’s interesting to talk to students about how they were lured off the course of medical school,” Madar-Aider said. “It really was exciting seeing the potential from the school to medical school and also know how educators leave themselves and faculty members in the afterworld.”\nFollow @sikevlesh for more on healthcare.\n']"
269,Expert Advice: Should ‘Snowbirds’ Stay or Go?,"['Don’t all stay up all night?\nIt is normal for couples to be locked in their rooms for a few hours at night. The adult circadian rhythm of the day can be disrupted in a way that makes them miserable. The circadian rhythm is what explains some of the most uncomfortable relationships in the world.\nOne explanation for this is that humans have always lived in a city where you don’t sleep. People do night work because the need for a sleep gets in the way. We sleep so late that there’s less of a time for many of us to do much of anything at all. To some extent, we got our cells wired up to keep busy, whether by sitting or by initiating meditation.\nThe more that we sleep, the less energy we expend. In fact, it’s the culprit that causes the majority of sleep deprivation. A recent study published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, investigated the effects of narcolepsy, sometimes known as insomnia, on the physical or emotional well-being of people and established a neuropathy level among users of the Internet. While it may seem counterintuitive, neuropathy is related to the way our brains work.\nIn other words, a person who sleeps like this doesn’t really have it bad. The part of their brain we think we know, the biological branch known as the early generation, that enables the neurons to emit the “wake” energy known as bling wire, can also produce snails and pests. Spire brain cells are thought to produce odorless oxygen and thus the body’s immune system attacks the messenger brain cells that are making our cells work.\nSleep-related symptoms are sometimes more pronounced in younger people than it is in people with fewer years of age or older. According to an article in Psychology Today, a “leawear sensation” in the sleep of a sleeping person helps to restore sleep and reduces the likelihood of a night of night stress. According to a recent study in the Journal of Addiction, the immune response to people’s insomnia is similar to a battle over a cup of tea. These effects, both in age and substance use, can occur pretty much anywhere from not “normal” to “normal” in a way that impacts the inner workings of the brain.\nMany people are suffering from sleeplessness because they’re sleeping too many hours and too little for comfort, but according to a recent study published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, this is not the case for many children who are related to the popular children’s holiday traditions. A 2007 survey of 12- to 15-year-olds found that 62 percent of those participating did not know they sleep are “low-hanging fruit.”\nTough balancing act, doesn’t go unnoticed, but what if there are still families that turn to children as well? This is something I’m going to continue to explore. Do children have more important social connection that relationships with older adults have been trying to do for them since the morning?\nParents may have an adult in mind when telling them to stop exercising or not cooking dinner, yet they usually end up doing both. Kids, in this case, may have more serious social reactions to the idea of missing dinner than adults do. Parents may even worry that they have no reason to want to reach out for their kids before the meal and cater to their needs. This is the kind of thinking that may save parents from having to wear adult sunglasses while parents attend to their child’s requests.\nUnfortunately, children are consistently distracted by social activities that they don’t want to hear about. They’re watching television or doing homework, and kids no longer seek to communicate with adults during this time. They don’t want to make social connections; they like to chase their own interests. They believe they’re on their own, that they can go anywhere, and no one has to stand in line to get in and out of a restaurant or bus stop.\nDo we really have to do it all to keep children happy? I hope so. I know many that believe all parents are made for each other, but are it really necessary that we leave ourselves and our kids as solely adults to fight it out at the dinner table?\n']"
270,The U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Coronavirus Cases,"['The U.S. is now leading the world in the scope of confirmed cases of the deadly intestinal virus Coronavirus, according to new government data that confirmed more than 1,000 new cases to date.\nSurveys in 26 counties, Alaska, Canada, Washington, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, and the U.S. Virgin Islands showed as many as one in every 16 cases of Coronavirus, the study found.\nCoronavirus, which usually causes mild or severe illness in children, is spread through close contact or direct contact between parents or caregivers who have not been vaccinated.\nThe disease will continue to grow in the U.S. and the world until its most widely available vaccine, the MMR vaccine, is widely available in young children. The government has never caught Coronavirus itself, saying an unknown number of children are not getting the vaccine due to concerns about the risk of being infected.\nThe U.S. is one of eight countries to pass a test to ensure all cases of the disease are generally well-tolerated, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n“Over the past year, we’ve developed a cluster of 17 effective vaccines and six measles vaccines,” U.S. infectious disease and public health officials said in a statement on Wednesday.\n“That means we have some work to do to deter any pathogen from finding its way into the United States,” CDC officials said.\nJuan Carlos Cordova, a pediatric infectious disease specialist with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said a vaccine is good enough to prevent infection even when it is not recommended, adding that patients and caretakers should still receive an MMR vaccine if they have that evidence of infection.\nCordova said patients should have a shot containing the vaccine, at least 50 milligrams per week.\nData from the CDC, the FDA, and other medical entities came out on Tuesday showing that 1,021 new cases were diagnosed in the U.S. from April 1 to April 1 in which children had symptoms resembling those of the virus.\nA total of 428 children, including 1,139 children who have been vaccinated with the MMR vaccine, were linked to the disease. Of those children who had been exposed, 2,323 were children younger than 18 years old, the CDC said.\nIn a statement, Eric Homan, M.D., commissioner of the FDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service, said there is no evidence for a link between the presence of “this contagious virus in the laboratory and the vaccine itself.”\n“If an individual remains ill for a number of weeks or months, the patient can be expected to be infected with either Coronavirus from a family member or contact with family members who are suffering from an infection,” he said.\nHoman said CDC officials had not yet determined whether any of the contacts were related to the vaccine, and were trying to determine how long it would take to find an infected child.\nHealth officials said full vaccine coverage for children under the age of 6 is not available, even for those younger than those in treatment. Vaccine coverage for men in the public health care system was not available, or any early vaccinations could help people get those shots.\nCDC officials said the vaccine does not require a second round of travel to a U.S. hospital, and vaccines are available to children in very sick states, such as Alaska, Idaho, North Carolina, Idaho, Kansas, and Utah.\nCDC said that while there were no studies showing the vaccine works strongly against the disease and is not designed to be used to treat everyone, it did offer its advice for those who are susceptible to it.\nCDC officials said that traditional vaccines should be used to protect against the virus in U.S. children, and suggested that kids around the world travel five days a week, instead of one day, to deliver vaccines.\nOfficials also said that the vaccination was not enough, in some countries, for anyone who was also infected with the virus.\nMore than 60,000 people have contracted the disease in the U.S. as of March, including 50,000 in Mexico, where it usually occurs about once a year.\n“While the diseases may not be the same, vaccines are strong enough to help protect against a wide range of potentially infectious diseases,” Michael Purdy, M.D., president of the disease management program at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, said in a statement.\nNearly all of the 50 cases of the disease were known to have been in children, said Dr. Frank Kolko, director of the Infectious Disease Disease Surveillance Program at Brigham and Women’s.\n“There really is no test or method that']"
271,Coronavirus Threatens an Already Strained Maternal Health System,"['Washington, DC — No one knows how the flu affects babies, but there has been far more than one cluster of mumps-like viruses in the country, and this epidemic is likely to affect our whole maternal health system—especially for women and men who become pregnant and have babies born prematurely.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed that two state outbreaks of influenza-like illness in Washington State, one in Lebanon and one in Washington DC. Finañila Tíaz, Ph.D., a CDC epidemiologist, visited a laboratory to look at 100 infections in the Washington D.C. area during the first month of February, when the flu was spreading. Of the 109 known infections, 67 were in Spokane and five in the Lettuce Farms area of Washington, Washington. Nine of the 109 cases reported in D.C. were in Spokane. All of the confirmed cases were reported at Spokane Valley Hospital. Two of the deaths were in Seattle.\nThe illnesses came to Seattle as the virus spread north. The whole outbreak took place as a result of H1N1 being developed outside of the U.S.\n“It’s really happening on a scale we could not have predicted,” CDC epidemiologist Sarah Kennedy said. “Our big news this morning is that D.C. had two and a half strains of flu, bringing a total to 78 confirmed cases this year,” she said. “Most of those who will become pregnant are women. When they’re pregnant, it’s a significant risk. We think the last couple of years of H1N1 really didn’t go as planned. And in some ways this flu is really right on track, just not to the best of expectations.”\nH1N1 strain influenza A is a genetically altered virus that first comes into the United States in 1918. The virus causes only mild-to-treat flu symptoms. If a person becomes pregnant, the family unit might also be infected. Vomiting, coughing, shortness of breath, muscle aches and panic attacks are common signs of influenza A. People who become pregnant should check their condition with doctors. Another leading cause of obstetric complications are hospitalizations.\nAccording to the CDC, even those who are genetically modified to be added to the H1N1 strain might be having difficulty following the symptoms. Others who may be infected with and continue to receive health care providers are also at risk of complications.\nFor those who seek health care, the most effective route is for the doctor or nurse to visit and speak with an infected patient. National Institutes of Health (NIH) researchers say there is a simple direct link between home visits and abdominal injuries. Other early signs of complications include:\nMissed birth: Bad sperm and egg formation\nChronic pelvic weakness\nDiabetes\nLose weight for 2 weeks after birth\nPhysical activity throughout pregnancy may not be sufficient to keep a child healthy, especially during pregnancy. Proper nutrition is also needed during pregnancy and the first month of pregnancy. To keep such symptoms at bay, experts suggest taking a short exercise program with your family members as they set small goals.\nThe flu season is when many pregnant women and men begin to pass on symptoms of the flu and what is commonly known as symptoms of the flu may be the same with some form of the virus. These symptoms include nausea, fever, cough, sneezing, stomach aches, bumps and cysts. The CDC says if you are pregnant, take early steps to protect yourself and family members. Look for your state of health and the indicators of the symptoms before your appointment.\n']"
272,Blood Plasma From Survivors Will Be Given to Coronavirus Patients,"['Some 11,000 survivors of an infectious disease caused by the bacterium leptospirosis will receive a new treatment that appears to induce a flow of blood plasma. The Blood Plasma from Survivors is among multiple major studies in humans supported by the National Institutes of Health that show that the treatment works to protect the immune system against a well-established threat to the survival of those infected with the disease.\nThe protein enzymes that make the pathway responsible for the blood plasma (SFPLV) are either deposited in the blood or destroyed to prevent blood movement. These are known as Ühythmia hemaglobalg, or thromas.\nVaporsic Caution: The chemo-based treatment is also known as Ühythmia-GA.\nFrom a longitudinal observation of 65,000 blood samples taken from consumers in 77 countries, Vasco Veda researchers were able to identify sufficient levels of Ühythmia hemaglobalg to deter virologists from prescribing the drug as a treatment for a heterogeneous group of patients with male, male and female patients.\nThe Ühythmia-GA treatment also appears to stimulate the normal function of the vernal pool of vernal cells.\nThe Ühythmia-GA therapy reverses a group of vernal cells that are slow to control vernal cell movement and thus function normally.\nBecause of its continued potency, Ühythmia-GA also shows clear antibacterial properties. It can effectively treat a number of serious vernal diseases, including cardiac arrhythmias, typhoid disease, hepatitis C, HIV, hepatitis C, HIV infection, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, and several types of cancers.\nSince Ühythmia-GA is used alongside other flu antiviral treatments, it is believed that this treatment is likely to be an effective and widely used one. Currently, new therapies for disease treatments provide sufficient protection.\nIn discussions with researchers at National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the US team found that Ühythmia-GA therapy almost severed Ühythmia hemaglobalg via the blood blood, and thereby impaired a rapid thrombectomy decision based on trauma severity.\nAntipsychotic drugs, namely One-pill, small, 150mg, can produce an increased oxidative stress, while vernal SFPplasene and its shamitinib combo –which in limited cases does not leave as much blood.\nOn Thursday, Aratana Therapeutics (atana.TO) reported data on Ühythmia-GA at the oral phase III study at the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAPI) and the 25-year course of Ühythmia-GA in cancer patients, however the project is highly dependent on clinical trials.\nThe current drugs have not reached the Ühythmia-GA stage.\nThat’s because Ühythmia-GA should not be released to chemo-resistant patients through standard treatment methods, according to Aratana.\nFor a further detailed review of Ühythmia-GA, please see Medical News Today, which discusses Ühythmia-GA in humans.\nImage Credit: Benjamin Graber / Shutterstock\n']"
273,"National Cathedral, Nasdaq, Businesses and Unions Locate Troves of N95 Masks","['Two hundred volunteers from the National Cathedral filled up a spare room for us to do. We were held in the midst of a portion of the cathedral and our emphasis was on the people. I have lived across the Bayou Road where many people haven’t have tables but instead a lot of furniture hanging in their bedrooms. It is hard enough for me to do all that we like on an average weekday night when I have not had my table for a half hour or so. The Reverend Justen Rasmussen on the other hand, work in the Humanities Department of the National Cathedral. I have studied Washington, D.C. for my PhD in architecture and have been fascinated with the kinds of designs and specialties in the Cathedral where people will be in great protest.\nI was struck by the shortsightedness in the Cathedral for all the moving graves and those who departed. The exception was the late Commander R. D. Hilton, who didn’t have a table so he and his wives could accommodate two adult but full-fledged monks in their 1,000 years ago terrace because their husbands were living with me and the culture they produced may have been different, as many people have told me. A few members of the clergy led flower flasks that were placed in the refreshment area and each had a votive candle. We entered with chairs and the flags representing the cathedral, wishing good health to a saddened soul. A few sea creatures trotted through the grounds, or pondered even shadows, and took the place of a living memorial.\nThe red, white and blue clouds were at once thick and crazy. The blue and white hearts of the American people were disappearing. The pagans who loved Jesus wrapped themselves around them, letting them fall away, and there was this solemn tapering of the coin rugs. The merchant and a number of men rose out of the clouds and reached down into the church floor, according to which someone took a coin and used it to explain Jesus. As each gentleman climbed over their white platform to see who got on the horse. Everyone in the background began to smile. I just remember thinking, “Man, really?” It was a sign of spring.\nThe vigil at the Cathedral lasted about two hours. Some of the moving graves there were added to the sunrise ceremony.\nThroughout the evening the demonstrators were greeted with such warm welcome that the police were ready to intervene.\nI was fairly well aware of the area where the vigil takes place but the atmosphere was as subdued as the prayer ceremony and people were being allowed to hang around and soak in the music. The long speech to a crowd of well-wishers, speakers and artists, including the likes of Rod Stewart, were on all manner of topics and would have made for some excellent readings.\nI remember sitting for a few minutes over a glass of water after the chanting of “thank you” which began with a few muttered words and a wave of authority in the voice of the onlooker. The large section of the cathedral was full of people but all the people in the crowd were protesting being asked to leave or leave with or without leaving. Some walked off and some made their way back down the concrete steps with one hand. Eventually the crowd took up the podium and were ready to leave with many empty bottles or cans as placards.\nIt was a happy evening! People are definitely enjoying every minute of it.\nMany working at the National Cathedral did their own readings. There was a priest one night who told the crowd that he had been directly delivered the letter of the Cross and if anyone tried to join us he would find it against his oath to do what he was saying and the pieces would eventually wrap around his body. The sermon was delivered by a second priest out of time which I think had a remarkable, generous impact.\nThe national cathedral is filled with the people who have lived all their lives in the midst of chaos. The people deserve to be protected and the people who are frustrated and in deep despair deserve some people, yet sadly, those who are no longer yet prepared to stand for the very things that they swore to bring joy and harmony to their community.\nI have met many unfortunate individuals, these are not the people I am eager to speak to.\nCongratulations, the prayers are for those who are and not. For those who do not have a presence at the Cathedral and haven’t been on such a lot to experience it.\n']"

275,Significance of Pangolin Viruses in Human Pandemic Remains Murky,"['Getty Images\nIn a year when food safety has been a top priority, one kind of food poisoning risk game has been hit the headlines every single day.\nResearchers at the Danish Institute for Protection of Animals and the University of Copenhagen report that Vibration, a prion responsible for recent signs of human infectious diseases, remained mired in this secrecy.\nVibration’s role in human infectious diseases has been relatively scarce. But researchers discovered in the days before the start of the influenza pandemic that as humans die from illnesses triggered by these prion dengue viruses, humans may appear to be responding to our body’s mechanisms of response by making information about vaccines and antiviral medicines. In some ways, this has freed up much-needed information about viruses and bird flu viruses.\nYet its importance is yet to be seen. Recent studies have shown that the virus can reach humans when the body is hungry and not only when the body starts to fight off the A-peids that cause the pandemic virus, but the ability to cause sick people to stay alive. It doesn’t have to happen this way. The Narsification Movement is looking at how vaccines and antiviral medicines might help prevent avian flu, E. coli, and salmonella infections—no animals and no human deaths are likely from that.\nBut it’s not the vaccine alone that should be on the medical front.\nThis pandemic is a wild card because people are unlikely to have sufficient information about influenza and bird flu in the future. But many of the details of this pandemic remain shrouded in secrecy, which makes it vulnerable to scrutiny.\nPeople’s exposure to avian flu is not restricted to these types of illnesses. For years now, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences has revealed some of the information that is collected on people during the initial stages of the disease. The records used to collect this information, and the exposure recorded during laboratory experiments, have been peer reviewed and showed plenty of misinformation in the U.S. animal medicine literature.\nWhile government-led efforts are on the backburner, federal scientists, biologists, and academic researchers will continue to work together to try to prevent the spread of these and other unproven viruses and their human cause. The focus now is on simulating the effect of avian flu—reducing the risk of transmission—in humans. That could be challenging, however, because at the time this work was being done, there was almost no way for the public to learn from previous predictions about this flu, as most confirmed cases have been associated with human infection.\n']"
276,When Dementia Meets the Coronavirus Crisis,"['DOCTORS at The Pacific Institute for Medical Research in Los Angeles have published the study, which looks at Dementia in our medical system, and shows how it affects a “special group of people” — those with mild cognitive impairment. What we’re missing is the enormous array of disease and treatment options available to them.\nAutism has no standard disease diagnosis — it only affects one at a time. But when it’s identified, brain scans reveal the result. It’s a cluster of muscle-bound, concentration-lacking individuals — straight out of the adolescent actress/pop star, who only had access to a tank of fluids and allergies. That diagnosis is most vividly described in 2015 when a 42-year-old man was admitted to the public-facing University of California, Davis hospital with preliminary brain swelling and later recovery, three times longer than the estimate of four dozen patients.\nIn this case, the complexity of the diagnosis cannot be overlooked. Early diagnoses include not only mild cognitive impairment — a neurological condition that includes a small part of the brain but needs far greater types of treatment — but a complete meltdown in basic functional memory. These type of cognitive changes create chronic mental and health anxiety and relive grief.\nPrevious studies, however, have shown that dementia will worsen over time, and typically harm patients.\nThe current study is published in the journal Arthritis & Rheumatism, which looks at a population of 49,655 people across 11 nationalities — people who are either mentally impaired, physically challenged, or members of the general population, with generally mild cognitive impairment. The group includes people with no mental health conditions, and the cancers that cause brains to shrink the most rapidly after death.\nIn its introduction, Dr. Elizabeth Balaban, director of research and policy for the advocacy group Research for the United States, argues that “there is significant evidence that dementia sufferers have a heightened risk of developing Alzheimer’s. The evidence for dementia is clear: consistent surveillance of brain activity.”\nWhen biological biomarkers are gathered from people with dementia, these are huge markers — more than 250 times that of the Alzheimer’s Association. Much of this data is being collected as part of research to explore the impact of disease on its markers, which is what we need. Researchers will need to assess people’s symptoms throughout their lifetimes and establish post-mortem nerve markers that show how memory and associated emotions play a role in cognitive decline.\nDr. Balaban, who is a director of the Pacerine Institute for Alzheimer’s Research, says our AI research industry needs to move beyond the lab work to evaluation doctors who will want to understand new treatment options — a task that is already necessary for many small studies.\n“The conversation must begin with shortening the treatment protocol for post-dementia patients,” says Balaban. “For people with mild dementia, there is little information available to assess the true severity of dementia or the patients’ condition.”\nSpeaking broadly about the need for a diagnosis, Balaban notes that before we became concerned that the National Institute on Aging’s admission guidelines do not adequately recognize dementia as a neurological disorder, the Physical Education, Behavior and Discipline (PBE) Guidelines for the Management of Mental Illness (PBE) established for state funding that warn of “hospitalization symptoms” that may be causing cognitive changes but without clear evidence. In addition, the guidelines are geared toward people with dementia who are physically strong or socially gifted, she says.\nAdditionally, Balaban adds, the AI study must cover what happens when patients with mild cognitive impairment exhibit all the symptoms of dementia that the NIH recommends. In her view, dementia — defined as “recurrent, disabling, irreversible impairment” — is a known clinical complication, with an estimated 6 million people globally living with moderate dementia.\nOther medical researchers have tackled dementia differently, but Balaban, who has a doctorate in Alzheimer’s and dementia from the NIA, is the first to examine these theories for this silent disease. This research could be the start of a trend.\n']"
277,A.I. Versus the Coronavirus,"['A.I. has been discovered to be infected with what appears to be an A.I. virus.\nThe mutation can be passed on, if a patient is not ill. But this one-negative bacteria, after the bacteria was put into one of the new strains, can still make it into much higher doses of antibiotics.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the A.I. virus was developed in the 1970s by Michelangelo and its parent A.I. was originally found in Guatemala.\nBut, these reports indicate that rather than initially vaccinating against the disease, the bacteria is now partially responsible for the outbreak.\nThe result is that, if the bacteria is found in a certain type of bacteria – the A.I. strain that was uncovered – then it could actually contain significant numbers of the bacteria being shot by the bacterium.\nThis is not the only example of how the A.I. mutation is contributing to a surge in A.I. disease cases. According to research from the Human Genome Project (HGEP), A.I. use some statistical model numbers that are unclear and don’t give enough time to get the vaccine against it.\nIn fact, even if any of the new A.I. viruses are extremely well spread by bacterium that is traditionally virulent, the disease hasn’t really jumped out.\nTo be on the safe side, say “the pathogen” from a virus\nIf the A.I. virus is transferred to the A.I. strain that has already been infected, the A.I. will bring it further along, spreading the virus. The answer is to simply put an A.I. virus in a series of small doses and that’s not too drastic, but the one-year bacteria dosage is almost certainly too long to spare if it gets larger.\nThis explains the most likely explanation for the spike in A.I. disease cases: that because bacteria can easily spread between humans, so that would likely lead to a spike in cases.\nThat’s how most people cope in the aftermath of A.I. get off to a high. A woman is subjected to a cocktail of antibiotics that contain the bacterium directly in her bloodstream. This means that she only has around 1-4 milligrams of A.I. per day – which is far too much for many women. But considering the current rate of circulating infection, women who have left their first trimester with an infection in their ovaries are more likely to have their baby gone in two weeks.\nThis means that although some women who are lucky enough to get vaccinated against A.I. in the first trimester – a vaccine was developed in 1973 but one that also needs to be fully doled out in the latter two – it’s become a very personal affair.\n']"

Among the moments taken at the same time, patients were especially in pain and unable to breathe.\nFour patients died after ambulances arriving at nearly four hours notice. Two of the 10 people who died died via infarct, with patient Richard Zueza one of the oldest. Ten others came from upstate hospitals and only six died directly outside of that first hospital where the service is now housed.\n“We’re in Disaster Mode,” said Martin Reich, chief executive officer of the city’s Department of Health.\n“The cameras were on. It was an environment where patients seemed to have time to recover. They would come in at 7:30 a.m. It was clear that they were feeling pretty fortunate,” he said.\nThe nursing home has reached out to the family members of those who died to get them the picture. “Our team’s compassion and deepest regret for these families,” said Health Commissioner JoAnne Kloppenburg, in a statement.\nThe New York Public Health Agency will compile information in the days following the annual Family Giving Dinner to help identify preventable and treatable causes of heart disease, strokes and other heart conditions. Researchers will then use the data to develop better guidelines.\n“We’re in Disaster Mode because we are dealing with a dangerous outbreak,” said Zoe Sorkin, editorial director at The New York Times and a former medical director at New York City’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “And we are also dealing with human traffic, disability and massive, overcrowded infectious outbreaks in over a quarter century.”\n“But it’s also because we’re experiencing long lines every day,” she said. “We’re not an island.”\nThe Health Department’s efforts to eliminate the now-repeated slow, stressful deaths, have come at the expense of health care professionals, she said. “We know that we have to improve the care we provide. But all too often, we don’t.”\nPlease turn on JavaScript.

I wouldn’t even get five minutes of his life,” she said.\nOr maybe this time was different. A City Council committee hearing last month focused attention on prevention, testing, and ultimately trying to identify hotspots. More than 300 people attended the hearing.\nThe city’s Department of Health also provided a report on West 13th Street hospitals on February 23. Since then, health authorities have identified more than 1,300 patients in jeopardy. And so far this week the hospital has opened emergency procedures to oversee the care of the other 35 patients and stabilize them before they are transported to a smaller facility.\nOn Wednesday, the department released a new report indicating that public health has been more vigilant on policy-related outbreaks since 2010. It also said that health officials have taken more of a proactive stance to better manage their monitoring of sick people, treating patients at the same time as disease control.\n“This year was actually very successful,” said an official from the Department of Health. “Our emphasis will be on prevention. We have got a view of what happens every day around city hall and on our state and local boards and commissions.”\nThe City Council also approved a plan by the Department of Health to demarcate neighborhoods with tight public health boundaries, a recommendation outlined in a draft plan published by the health agency’s Incident Management unit.\n']"
279,What Made New York So Hospitable for Coronavirus?,"[""The city of New York is just a few blocks away from a local hospital for the Florida woman with a rare, dangerous viral illness. A man in a wheelchair seems to have struck the perfect balance between taking care of his family while at a different time of day and helping each other when there are significant health concerns.\nJaylenand His Tragedy\nJaylenand His Tragedy was an NHS case patient in Mac Mac and the care he received was bound to be an overwhelming hospital. He is lucky to have the freedom to recover at this time, but his horrific experience nonetheless sums up the complicated and sometimes bloody disease that has plagued any local population since approximately the 1840s.\nJaylenand His Tragedy\nA passing accident involving a McDonald's employee came to blame for the deadly hospitalization. For years, the family was unaware what was going on with an infectious disease virus, or the fact that these sick individuals still had life in them after a devastating accident. The infected worker was put in a paralysed position that would have made finding another job more difficult. People who receive the disease typically spend time feeling unable to get into the lives of themselves; they become confused and even lose sense of humor.\nMedical Workers are highly familiar with the symptoms of avian influenza or A. A traveler on a Global Islands and on/off the island at least over a year earlier with cases of the virus exists. Humans developed avian influenza in their mid-latitudes and regions in Asia as late as 1947,\nThe virus may have spread to America, but was strongly observed by rats or mice. Many vets and doctors were unaware of the virus until its appearance in 1968. It has long been recognized as the most prevalent infectious illness causing mild to severe illnesses in humans, other than heart disease, stroke, or a form of leukemia.\nExpatriates are more likely to take significant steps to prevent their illnesses and keep themselves on good form than the rest of the population. Several decades after the fever peaked, the public was fully aware of this issue. As public health funding shrinks, non-resident immigrant patients are more likely to catch infectious diseases. Thanks to increased awareness of the virus, healthcare costs have dropped dramatically.\nNowhere is this more evident than in Florida. Infamous grandmother and five-year-old daughter were sick for nearly two months while visiting a family member. During this time, their mother had announced that she would move with her family and visit the state, so instead of allowing them to leave, the family moved to an organization she had not previously worked with, The Florida Health Research Institute.\nAlthough still in remission, with improved health and money, the family had some time to rest and recover, but their diagnosis wasn't as bad as many physicians thought. Instead of requiring the family to stop running after meals and of often seeing how the symptoms seemed, the family was encouraged to go to the friends and neighbours for help that was necessary. A friend turned out to be extremely sympathetic.\nswatson.ne@verizon.net\nClick to share on Twitter | Facebook | Google + | email\n""]"
280,Who Knew Grocery Shopping Could Be So Stressful?,"['A fresh look at one of the biggest roadblocks to grocery shopping has long-suffering customers worried.\nAt some points, it\'s been at the forefront of negative emotions. But that\'s slowly changing.\nThough grocers have always come under fire for spending more than they\'re trying to make, today\'s supermarket mentality reflects the deepest sense of fear and anxiety Americans have about the place food has always been in people\'s lives. Now, executives and a market researcher have new research to say that eating of supermarket staples has decreased all but one bit since 2015.\nAmerica\'s largest grocers are actually the weakest link in the food supply chain. For many Americans, the second most expensive item after food costs their grocery bill. Adding gas costs and food are at the apex of a chain\'s largest costs.\nGrocers have created a command center to determine how much you spend at an area\'s grocery store, and with each report, they come up with high-end price estimates for different categories (think food plus chemicals). These sales bar are reflective of grocery markets\' overall profits, so people just end up going with the most expensive product.\nAt least at grocery stores, that implies the quality is pretty good -- no expense is spared to make the most of the ingredients, and the wait time to sell groceries can be awful. Whole Foods CEO Brad McMillan said he expected to see less such reporting in 2019, arguing it ""comprehenses much of the plumbing"" in what grocery shelves hold.\nBut the shift is not limited to grocery stores. There\'s also a certain sea change. Thanks to grocery competition, small regional chains now have the most options. The Supervalu and Amex supermarkets all compete to keep shoppers at the front of the line with healthier foods.\nOur Phobias After All\nSmart initiatives that make grocery shopping simpler and more convenient will do much to address this pressure, but they haven\'t had much ripple effect on the supermarket sector. Indeed, the brick-and-mortar supermarket industry has enjoyed a healthy path to profitability due to its consistent pricing power, cheap money for inventory, and high earnings. It\'s also been a relatively resilient sector.\nAnd that\'s why more retail giants are rushing to become supermarket champions. Even better, since the sector is heavily fragmented, companies are terrified of losing too much on their front lines in an effort to keep their grocery dominance at bay.\nWhile supermarkets might not have to worry about price cuts just yet, those plans appear to be coming to fruition. Some grocery stocks have already signed an agreement with Wal-Mart to lower their ""crocodile"" price throughout the year. The more established grocers are adding single-brick package deals to their convenience stores.\nThese small regional chains have proven to be extremely resilient even as they put up insecurities. Will they be able to continue this trend in the future? We\'re always careful to examine any possible impacts of such initiatives in the context of the retail system. But right now, there\'s a long way to go in determining if the purchase of ""cold cut"" foods from a supermarket will be perceived as a riskier purchase.\nRelated: 20 Don\'t-Be-a-Little Tricks to Save Money\n']"
281,‘God Will Protect Us’: Coronavirus Spreads Through an Already Struggling Pakistan,"['TARI B IJK\nTweet\nTel Aviv (Tel Aviv’s) has been hit by a triple poisoning that has claimed seven lives. Almost 12 weeks ago, a microbus with 11 paracetamol tablets and syringes, ferrets, and the liver, was hit by the gastroenteritis, or gastroenteritis, in a hospital in Jerusalem. In such cases a blood sample must be taken in order to complete the test so that information such as the number of people in the current hospital, their health condition and the overall viral burden can be gathered.\nEvery year, as many as 43 million people have been affected by the virus, and by the fact that it is spread by a virus in a way that is already endemic to a country which is also prone to epidemics, it is important to make this public - it should not be overshadowed by a diagnosis of a specific person with a potential propensity to do so. Some of those infected could be chosen for treatment, but others should not be allowed the virus to spread fast, dangerous epidemics. So far, a number of “unsafe” healthcare systems in Arab countries that have yet to adopt effective treatment have become accustomed to the virus. Most infections, especially in childhood, don’t infect adults, but often children and children’s mothers suffer from diarrhoea and vomiting when they are infected. This can lead to severe loss of health and to certain suffering. Unfortunately, in many countries now, there is a method of avoiding the virus, in which infection from childhood is cut short.\nUnfortunately, the most available method of addressing this problem is to vaccinate children against the virus. But a simple diagnosis, such as a vulva infection, may not help, so one should be able to recognize the virus even when doing so is inadvisable, and vaccination even if easy. It is widely known, however, that not everybody understands the severity of a viral infection. This also led to lack of routine vaccinations and recommendations. Moreover, who decides to vaccinate must also act instinctively in recognising the severity of the disease and making appropriate precautionary efforts to prevent contagious diseases.\nThis cannot happen in most any country, since most of the patients affected by the Virus in Israel, despite many indicators such as international aid pledges, and national health surveillance systems, often fail to curb the virus from spreading fast. If a vaccine is procured to be given for routine routine life-saving monitoring, only five years of, or even zero, vaccination has been lost in public, especially in the minds of the public, and 90 per cent of all cases of untreated disease are preventable. This proves that vaccines do not always work in the vaccine scenario because if not, there are still others with similar traits, and therefore it is difficult to implement the prevention measures needed in some developing countries. If patients are included in the prevention measures, the present pool of people which will receive adequate treatment can act as a guide.\nUnfortunately, so far, Israel has not taken the measures required for understanding that there is a chance the virus will spread through very small time period (showing family contact) and often thrives within a group of infected individuals. But future cases are happening with more frequency, which is understandable when there is a large body of data which points to the likelihood of a new pandemic.\n']"

Photos show makeshift tents inside the military hospital that serve as a makeshift ""vaccination hospital"" for those dealing with the disease.\nAfghanistan’s largest hospital system, replacing hospitals in all regions around the country, is now moving almost 9,000 cases of Ebola to its center in the eastern city of Ramazan.\nAccording to state media, nine children and adults died from the disease in 2014 and the World Health Organization said that the disease spread to one death in 2015.\nGuinea has confirmed that it is the biggest killer of West Africa with 6,300 cases. The United Nations says 5,000 people have died from Ebola in West Africa.\nThis is the fourth Ebola outbreak in the continent, following Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\nThere are currently only approximately seven confirmed cases of Ebola in the eastern and southwestern regions of West Africa.\nOn Monday, President Hamid Karzai said it would be “quickly” to send aid teams to the areas affected by the outbreak, reports AP.\nPresident Karzai said a specific task would be to pump more than 100,000 additional meals into the sick people, as well as to provide them with more medical care.\nEarlier this week a United Nations official said 42 international researchers were working in the areas affected by the virus. He also confirmed that the virus was affecting the city of Port-au-Prince, adding that it was only over a week since the start of the outbreak.\nMore than half of the people who have arrived in Port-au-Prince were between the ages of 16 and 25.

283,U.S. Now Leads the World in Confirmed Cases,"['When the U.S. Army assumed the global leadership in warfighting in the 1960s, an additional form of national security was gaining its center. The first command in the history of U.S. armed forces enlisted people of various national nationalities, often men and women of varying nationalities, at a veterans service orientation program in Texas and Louisiana in the 1970s.\nThe system also officially recognized veteran state and local systems of “assisting the clear conduct of civil affairs,” a recognition that occurs across national military bases. In fiscal year 1995, all U.S. military bases had been formally named “Defence Headquarters” (DHQ). Federal sources estimate that at least seven DOD posts outside the headquarters were designated for DHQ support operations.\nThe work that the multi-billion-dollar “fortress personnel presence” enables the military does not specifically support national security policy. The national security military chief has the ultimate responsibility of supporting national defense policies and public policy, and civilian leadership has the ultimate responsibility of carrying out those policies.\nBy blending states to provide support to the armed forces, the DOD has promoted the military. In the 1970s, after the Vietnam War, the U.S. went to war and was leading the world during various occasions including the holocaust, racism, and the Cold War. In the 1980s, the central command in the Pentagon’s Joint Operating Command took charge and carved out special command areas of the U.S. armed forces in defense of the country.\nThe assumption of national security is achieved, by the latter, through the emergence of the Pentagon as an energy, logistics, and combat advocate. In the present day, not only did the Department of Defense oversee both traditional defense and modern defense practices, but also fully participated in the Paris climate change negotiations.\nTo observe the dominant role of the Pentagon in the global war on terror, identify the real potential battlefields and potential battlefield challenges. As a consequence, the war on terror has become a backdrop in major conflicts including Iraq and Afghanistan. The U.S. defense strategy and the technology it employs is now defined to be the most advanced in world history.\nThe Japanese surrendered to the Americans in 1945 on New World Order missiles, evoking Cold War phenomena such as Communism and the Soviet Union. Since the start of World War II, another distinction has emerged in Washington. Congressional intelligence committees under Obama have played a role in defining exactly how Washington is managed and executing foreign policy in the era of global terrorism. On numerous occasions, the secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, of the Pentagon, has testified in support of military action in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nBy large, military defense accounts do not include perceptions and preconceptions. President Trump does not wish to see military personnel’s role reflected in the public discourse. Instead, he seeks to turn domestic policy and national security into military priorities. This means, of course, that new Pentagon policies regarding military operations are seemingly in shambles.\nIn his first public appearance in Texas, President Trump’s nominee for secretary of defense, James Mattis, expressed concerns about Pentagon governance and organizational issues as a result of shifting power from the internal executive branch to the Defense Department. But Mattis’s concerns lay behind a plan Trump is expected to unveil on Tuesday to address the U.S. military establishment.\nThis is a special time when Congress and the administration should take legislative action on countering global terrorism. Its operation in Congress and with the Pentagon should offer the potential to find common ground before it splits the defense community. Our defense resources, even those in the active rounds of American life, are limited by the overarching question of conflict, whether from which our resources would be retrogressive or self-sufficient. If so, we should consider reviving the sound and well-conceived debate about military power, at the center of a global task, in a way the United States would surely not have to deal with.\nAs the president proceeds down the path toward achieving his goals of transformational change in the global war on terror, it will be up to lawmakers to establish their views on all aspects of military operations.\n']"

Since then, it’s been painful for the newly married businessman, with life-threatening neurological damage from the disease. Now, Chen is trying to recover from what’s been an extremely public illness by helping to spread the infection to his family.\nChen’s first step in doing so, however, is to ensure he’s OK. “That’s my objective; to make it okay for my family and friends and my friends to visit,” Chen tells the Times.\nTo help, Chen tried to eat two portions of fruit one morning before he took a trip to Florida earlier this week. The salad then affected him, and by the time he was ready to eat, the wound he suffered from had gone from a normal three weeks to a stem cell transplant.\nAs he spoke to friends at his hotel in San Francisco, he explained that he would only eat just a portion of fruit, while the caterpillar would follow. “The caterpillar was doing like normal, but my stomach was spinning, it turned swollen,” Chen explained. “I was almost tense. It was so strange,” he said, reports Times.\nDoctors diagnosed Chen with a form of lymphoma (a type of skin cancer) that required 24 hours of surgery. While his liver looked good after the surgery, Chen will never be able to come to terms with it. He’s especially grateful that there is no symptoms that can be shown when an infection is caused by Coronavirus. “You can’t stop the effects,” Chen says.\nIt’s unclear whether Chen is still in therapy or sick or is making improvements. Since the illness caused the star host to lash out in a viral video last year, Chen has donated nearly 4,000 parts of his face and eye skin to a nationwide health campaign called “Coronavirus Reading.” He has also donated more than $2,000 to the Soyrow 8 (Foodaslutydonz.org) and Cancer-Control’s Melas™ Fund.\nGet the latest Hewlett Packard stock price here.\n']"
285,How to Get More Sleep Tonight,"['In February, I spent the summer in one of the sickest of places — Sea Camp in India. I had made dinner before bed and was isolated from the entire family until June.\nInstead of resting, I took a lot of nights and nights off from my sleep. I read before bed and had a regular routine. I skipped certain exercises that my body agreed to, such as getting dressed and reading, and a good amount of sleep over the weekends. I left the house alone for so long because it was the only option for me and, as a result, I experienced pain and other symptoms in the next week or so. And then, once I went home, I lay awake to try to understand what I was experiencing. It was jarring and then exhilarating, but I found that I understood and was like a child again. So, when I came to the conclusion that this was the best way to get a lot of sleep this season, that was a good time to start becoming more aware of what I was experiencing.\nI had applied to four Respiratory Health Institutes in the past. I had my consultant refrained from running my gynecologist’s exam because I already knew my mortality potential. But, even at my recommended four hour daily schedule, I found it absurd that an hour would make me more uncomfortable than an hour or two before my scheduled appointment. After meeting with my consultant, I was doing just that. I found it incredible that they had kept me awake for so long.\nHere are a few tips that you can consider yourself by now:\n1. Get a cool sleep in a quiet, beautiful place, usually at bedtime, while alone.\n2. Let your sleep dreams fail.\n3. Own your sleeping dream.\n4. Reevaluate what you should be doing that you’re not consciously doing.\n5. Do it with your mind.\n6. Look for a good night’s rest.\n7. Start your own sleep routine.\n8. See the world through your eyes.\n9. See how hard it is to get out of bed.\n10. Write “Freedom” on a piece of paper.\nDon’t run to a bank or to your nearest psychic.\nDon’t stay awake.\nDon’t drive.\nDon’t watch a TV or radio, TV, movies or a movie.\nDon’t judge yourself.\nDon’t lose yourself.\nDon’t resent anyone you may be experiencing something bad.\nDon’t force yourself to break your dreams.\n']"
286,Can You Become Immune to the Coronavirus?,"['The Worcestershire Public Health Department started a project to replace any remaining infectious viruses around Shore House Cemetery in Stroud Castle, Stockton. A simple computer program called SpotTrack was established for the use of firefighters to detect any diseases they may detect within the cemetery. As the event continues to grow in popularity, the precise stage of the programme has grown.\nThe early stage of the programme has allowed the Worcestershire Public Health Department (WPHD) to test patients, live in an isolated location in the memory of family members when they travel to ward off the contagious virus, more at a time.\nIn two ways, spotting the virus might provide the initial insight needed to help test therapies and find cures for diseases such as infection. The earliest method used was to turn a metal rod into a microscope for testing the tiniest of viruses. But this method has only ever been used on participants in a series of test outbreaks, or “run-style” outbreaks, until an outbreak was discovered in the barracks at the East Liverpool barracks in 1986.\nIn recent months, doctors have been racing the clock to identify a protein that breaks down the first part of the first strand of the infective virus. Another experiment in this direction has drawn increasingly developed interest in vaccine safety.\nThese tests include a recent case in which humans were put through an expedited feed of the virus without making a diagnosis. The blood test revealed that the virus had mutated, initially producing a thrombosis and then a new lumps in the skin that could develop into a second bite of the disease. This more aggressive strain of the virus was then inserted into the final strain. The resulting rash was captured by a oncologist at the time.\nRadical discoveries in this early stage of studies were stymied until 2002 when the University of South Australia set up a ground-breaking project to use scalpel-powered microscopes for detecting the virus with more scalpel dexterity.\nThe technology is now being used in medical labs across the world. Researching the virus can allow patients to understand it from their own health, as medical teams can protect themselves against infection by developing immunological testing techniques.\nPeople with the tracheostomia osteoarthritis joint infection (also known as a severe case) have a low need for chemotherapy and oncologists should not hesitate to prescribe a dose of chemotherapy. This is because patients are often less able to live peacefully and immune systems appear to be compromised.\nFor the majority of people with osteoarthritis, the specific way the protein found in the bacteria swells and damages blood vessels is unknown and I was concerned this would inhibit their growth and be disruptive to their recovery.\nHowever, the gold standard of such tests, which The Associated Press has uncovered, has been the detection of antibodies to slow the progression of the virus. The researchers have recently been able to show them that a clear antibody to the virus can reduce the progression of the disease and allow the body to cure it from the virus itself.\nStroud Castle Cemetery, in Stockton – with the RI campus situated only metres from the next house in Coronavirus Wreck – is known locally for hosting around 3,000 people a week, which can make a week the budget of a care home. The location was recently named as one of the top destinations for people who visit the cemetery on their return to the UK.\nAccording to the Durham County Register of Agencies, The Wyke Road, on North Reading Road, WGA Durham County, was the first cemetery in the UK to provide lead tests for the disease. This led to 50 new cases recorded on the Lawn Care Trust roof panel between September 2001 and November 2003, 16 that caught up to the remains of the police officer’s son who was shot in the head with a bullet in March 2002. The hospital then offered a £10,000 “game” sponsorship deal with the Reading Area Work Group after a stray bullet was brought into the office.\nThe award-winning Trust can only assist when necessary, however, as most cases have taken place at the grounds themselves. This leads to a pre-planned housing estate at the end of the cemetery where a new roof on the roof was acquired. One tube in the roof has not been completed and the rest of the roof is being removed.\nThe Trust does not accept donations or grants from charities or individuals.\n']"

288,A Homeless Family Navigates a Life Warped by the Coronavirus,"['GLENDALE, Ariz. (AP) — A family living in a camper van washes its feet in ocean air on the Phoenix-Fresno flight to Chile on the brink of losing half its life expectancy in a virus that causes killer pneumonia and causes organ failure in adults and children.\nCare workers and rescuers along with a doctor next to them had gathered at the Villuevano d’Aventura flight hangar, 85 miles (230 kilometers) south of Los Angeles, on Sunday night to pay tribute to Terry Nelson and another mother who drowned while staying in their tent with her four children, ages 4 to 15.\nNelson has a fractured skull and left knee injury that was diagnosed with lung cancer before he was diagnosed. Like the families of Tina Port, Tammy Valdes, and Katherine Porjas, the families in the vans remained in the cramped two-story van, where the heat and humidity lifted in an angle as it rolled through the blue skies below.\nThe van’s was barely adequate for two people staying in one of the tiny tent hotels.\nAt least four families who had been staying at the Mariposa Bay Resort & Restaurant on Monday night came for the vigil, which was one way to express a feeling of despair.\nThere were many shocked faces, not the ones who heard the familiar television news or news report on Nelson’s death. They were the ones who tried to walk over and under the tent to shout for a moment, until it was too late, and all the other people who tried to feed their six children and then washed their hands of Nelson’s body.\nThey said the last time they saw her, she was glowing.\n“It’s horrible. Everyone just wants to be happy and can’t even talk about what happened,” Rebecca Martin, an assistant to the nurse in charge of the care of Nelson, told the Phoenix newspaper.\nThe nurses, Christa Turnbow and JoAnn Bach, worked on long days in the care of Nelson, who was staying at the Mariposa Bay Resort & Restaurant with her husband, Daimon Wendell. The couple had died earlier this month, too.\nThe nurses had been unable to change his diaper until they went in the other direction to follow. The nurses repeated the same mantra many took as a warning to Nelson and the other families from Tampa to Taipei.\n“You can only believe something so good can happen,” said Carol Glover, a nurse who would like to bring Nelson back home for a few more nights. “We’re trying to give him a day off to recover, but we’re also trying to give him some time to live so he can continue to heal.”\nAs the family walked to the bathroom, Glover told each of the children, “he’s tired of you. We want to hug you.”\n“He’s a tough guy and he’s so proud of who he is,” she told the children. “He knows what it means to be human.”\nNelson went to help Port in February 2016 after Valdes, who was staying in one of the tent hotels, hadn’t received enough rest because Port was struggling to stay pregnant.\nPort died in April 2017 at the age of 29. Valdes, who died in September 2017, is still alive in the van. Neither were wearing face masks. Valdes can be seen swaddled in a black bathrobe and she wears a face mask.\nValdes told the nurses that her daughter is 15 months pregnant with her fourth child, although she is due in June. Valdes said she doesn’t know whether Port has a healthy pregnancy, and said the doctors there are wondering if any of the children have been harmed or if the couple could be completely ill.\nThe family lived in a caravan on the Texas-Mexico border, fishing for food and drinking and sleeping away at the hotel. Their only money was in the insurance policy that Lake San Jorge started insurance-wise in the summer of 1997. They also have a coat on each head of the family.\nLike Port, Nelson could not climb up to the smoking tent like other families once did — only he could.\n']"

(Gabriel Perez Garcia Marquez), an immigrant from Colombia, telegraphs money to his girlfriend of seven years, Marie (Judi Dench). There, he describes his role in the set-up of ""Brazilian-English Slaves,"" a friendship with a poet whose series of bogus literary imports indicates her disorder. Her profound and moving wanderings increase the sense of ""in the darkness of the colon,"" and can go unnoticed by her coddled husband until he disappears. Mario can smile a little toward his girlfriend, and while their sex life doesn\'t appear to match their age, he is, consciously or subconsciously, showing Rafael\'s old flame.\nAccording to Autographia , this dynamic has echoes of Matisse\'s ""Mannequin,"" the famous madcap automaton for ""Paris pinball"" through which Argentine Mannequin Laurens rode his currency, rendering modernism in the ghetto in ""Milan"". The Spanish-style mannequin Laurens (which may be the generic name of this personified), is, in effect, an adult shadow bossing his minor workers like a bunch of grey squirrels in “Melfyrus.” In certain instances he is stuck, on art-deco pedestals, because his superiors are Nacho or Nacho I, whom he thinks is his father\'s chauffeur.\nAlthough they were impossibly wealthy, they seemed to put off much of the world.

His only advocate was her daughter (a young girl), not her wealthy cousin.\nMario disappeared, and Rafael Emery decided to join him.\nThe truth of all this information is that people can change their lives, through being caught and found. What\'s more, they can change with good intentions. For most of us, that means taking part in the deeply personal journey from ""relationship to relationship"" and ""relationship to relationship."" As Jose Farias observed, the spectrum is strikingly different from what we see if we started out in the home office. But even after dying for years, we have different experiences, but more frequent experiences, whether in our lives as social media influencers, family members, neighbors, friends, co-workers or companions.\nLet\'s be honest: we\'re building a living culture by following that line of ""normalcy,"" and we are often robbed of that. It\'s the experience of living for whom the husband decides to be by his side that is becoming traditional. It\'s the pain of pursuing that independence, and spending eternity in the virtual world of superficial intimacy. We get to know the people we love, the minds and memories that render their passions incongruous. We get to discover their elusive personalities, and the toll that money plays on their lives, doing it for us after twenty-five years. It\'s a process of accelerated sharing, even, in silence.\nThat\'s all very lost in the new stories of English-language fiction, in which European writers on the one hand share their experiences and sometimes humor with a seemingly complex plot, on the other hand. The English-language characters do not want to be portrayed as polysexual intellectuals or street types, or men of crazy sexuality. They want to be brought up. Often they do not have the urge to do so, and are quickly brought back to life by their novelistic experiences. They spend their entire lives worrying about their blossoming careers, whether they\'re a novelist or a professional writer. And all too often, they are dragged through story to create real life, offering real insight into the wonderful world of immigration and big business.\n']"
290,‘What Are the Symptoms?’ ‘Is There a Cure?’ and Other Coronavirus Questions,"['Depending on how real scientists are, the symptoms of some mysterious illness, or at least one, can vary greatly depending on the cure-the-symptoms question. Over the course of a thousand studies, we’ve learned that researchers are at least partly responsible for the fragility of some mysterious viruses—particularly germophilia—but at what point does a cure emerge? As Jeff Epstein might tell you, “what a simple lack of information is.”\nA team of researchers says in an e-mail, that questions of reported stages of a common or unidentified virus can determine if the immune system attacks the receiver for a particular subset of viruses that has been contracted.\nFor instance, in a paper published last year in the journal Nature, Ellen Reller, the principal investigator of the study, and colleagues—including Steve Mahler, director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the chair of the department of microbiology and Immunology at the University of Texas at Dallas—combined mouse models to identify many of the gut biomarkers that may have been contributing to this decision-making.\n“They report that as the observed symptoms become less common, rashes develop and other flu-like symptoms,” the researchers write. “The number of symptoms is also reduced by the maturity of the virus.”\nEven so, their data suggest that understanding the condition is what scientists are working on.\nInfluenza (a possible reason we have no real good answers about why vaccines do not work) rates among human people about 70 percent, “revealing deep chills,” write Rachel Shough and M. Timothy Gladwell of the University of Chicago in an e-mail response. Their new study, for instance, describes “a burst of flu ‘living matter’ that is more frequently attended by people who have a compromised immune system” after influenza vaccinations.\nThe researchers, authors Tim Pomerantz and William Sanderbeck, also cite the “Hepatitis B” virus as an example. Interestingly, Epstein and Sanderbeck’s paper could be a less ambiguous symptom of the new infection, as well.\nEpstein and Sanderbeck’s paper quotes another study that shows that relatives and those who have of that same virus can be at higher risk for H3N2 as they experience more aggressive symptoms.\nOther researchers cite a different experiment that proved that people with mild symptoms of the flu are a lot less likely to die from the virus. So researchers say the potential consequences of this experiment is limited to those with the same disease.\nThey suggest that these findings should be considered science-based. For instance, they point out that the BCA can cause inflammation in a variety of different tissues—such as the lungs and brain—and that a virus can’t cause symptoms until after it’s emerged.\nAnd, they add, “Appropriate methods to deliver antiviral medications also are needed. The same goes for infection management at the care facility in the lab.”\nIndeed, as Epstein and Sanderbeck write, “harnessing this expertise with the proven gamine antiviral treatment including antibodies is only one more tool in the arsenal for preventing any potential vaccine-related medical complications.”\nThough the researchers aren’t sure when the new question will emerge, they say it will be around a “general population.”\nEpstein and Sanderbeck write that they will be launching a 2015 editorial on Pandemic Influenza—an open-access book titled “The Secret Weapon of Infection Response” (published in 2015).\n(More recently, Epstein and Sanderbeck, in a 2011 paper on tuberculosis and the 1918 bacterium known as Zondervan, suggested that all modern tuberculosis infected by infected individuals with novel strains of the virus should be vaccinated against it.)\nBy Mihir Radwan, reviewed by Tiara Guophouse.

Photo Credit: Emmett Marbella/Shutterstock\nCan federal support for access to behavioral and mental health services for disabled people and other people with mental and physical disabilities be worked, even if the government shuts down, after a few years of rapid growth?\nThat’s the message from letters poured into small towns in rural Pennsylvania on Tuesday that have expressed opposition to a proposal to install continuous monitoring systems in terminally ill and critically ill people’s homes and jail facilities, one of the most crucial indicators of recovery from a variety of mental illness and prescription drugs.\nThat’s something local officials must either call for or have ideas to deliver to the White House.\nBut considering the District of Columbia’s recent death of Supervisor of Education Pat Durkin and the state of Virginia’s response to the murder of Public Education Officer Breanna Johnson, one might be tempted to ask whether federal intervention should be based in mind.\nAt least the D.C. Department of Mental Health gave its support to an alternative comprehensive approach in March, but delayed for several months in part because of buzz about mental health-related scams targeting veterans.\nIt’s still unclear who would be stepped up to take over? If Durkin’s diagnosis leaves her without medication or if her son stops taking medication for more than a month, she’ll have to wait until a ruling — and possibly the Endangered Species Act — takes effect on Sept. 29.\nAs previously discussed, the center in Westminster, Virginia, would establish a network of social support rooms for people with disabilities and build in specialized evaluation centers, similar to those currently under construction in California and New York.\nThe primary goal would be to help achieve ongoing goals, and use a mixture of medications and behavioral and mental health resources to help people to do better, ultimately see the benefits, said Dan Jensen, executive director of the Centre for Stabilization Solutions to the Commonwealth of Virginia and a veteran advocate.\nIf implemented, the centers would be able to try to help reduce the number of people who end up in jail after a long period of recovery from mental illness and drug abuse, said Janson.\nOf course, individuals with specific mental and physical needs would be likely to seek extra help if things went badly out of whack, Janson said. In September, CNN reported that 1 in 5 Americans with a mental illness experience short-term or long-term mental or physical health problems.\nMany advocates in Washington, D.C., rallied Tuesday to bolster support for existing programs that would provide mental and physical health services to people with disabilities or those who have no access to primary care. One of them, the Mark McGrath Foundation, raised more than $150,000 in just a week in support of an Edna McKinney Watershed Protection Act grant that would provide financial assistance to counselors for people with any such needs.\nA spokesman for the Peoples-City Council, which serves every four-square-mile area of the city, would not comment on the specific applications.\n“This is just the tip of the iceberg,” said Marcia Neffferman, a spokeswoman for the state of Virginia, which also announced two of its programs. “When VA decides to be part of the system, we’ll let people know if we want to help.”\nThe Trump administration has faced criticism for its apparent abandonment of psychiatric care for millions of people with disabilities and other conditions, including MSRTP.\nMental health advocates in Washington expressed surprise about that policy change. For them, passing a bill that keeps local agencies from placing treatment beds at existing ones would have been akin to putting Medicaid out of business.\n“Let’s not separate the sick from the desperate,” said Stacie A. Thompson, a senior fellow with the Demos Initiative on Mental Health. “In Maryland, a disabled person is under Medicaid and they’re under emergency care. What if they go to a traditional facility, and that person is the invisible wounded? It’s like putting the Angel in a box for the terminally ill person.”\nStates typically have tried to make the same social and mental health work for those with the most mental health needs, making it easier for the executive branch to upend existing ones without interference from the federal government.\nBut the legislative options aren’t being so easy, and the fight is far from over, said Nathan Brase, an expert in addiction issues and family planning and a leader of the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n“As people ask people what they']"
292,Gilead Withdraws Request for Special Orphan Status on Experimental Virus Treatment,"['On Thursday the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) temporarily withdrawn a request for assistance to develop a new line of the antiretroviral antiretroviral therapy (ART), formally called Ivar de la Rosa for the treatment of patients with primary leukemias, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), people with two or more COPD exacerbations and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nAccording to KNOX-TV, De la Rosa is considered to be one of the top five contributing factors in maintaining or blocking COPD exacerbations. Other contributing factors include another factor that might push BMD exacerbations into remission later in life: school instability. While 2014 reports show that COPD exacerbations are on the rise, the FDA has yet to reach an agreement on the study protocol with KNOX-TV.\nThe FDA’s position was well-known to some of the scientists at Chero Institute in Berkeley, California, who worked on many of the catalysts of Ivar de la Rosa’s groundbreaking medical breakthroughs.\nIn 1999, drugs using a parasite called Creutzfeldt-Jakob virus (CJD) were discovered as a complement to a series of AIDS treatments known as antiretroviral therapy (ART). CBD, containing a protein called CD4B011, disrupts the replication of viruses by changing their immune response to eliminate their protective immunosuppressive activity. The drugs are safe and effective, but they have become the subject of broader debate as an antiretroviral therapy’s ability to prevent unexpected medical episodes.\nART was first proposed by the USDA in July 1998 as a “priority under study” for discovering what could be believed to be a “sexually fatal” infection of the intestinal tract. The FDA’s approval was contingent on the necessary data to determine the treatment’s risk to human populations, that it would be based on risk assessment, and that there was no evidence of the primary source of the virus. In July of 1998, the agency rescinded its initial order, asserting that its time had come to review Ivar de la Rosa’s dataset.\nLuminary: New treatment could make medicine more effective, but limit risks\nThe FDA now wants the agency to investigate whether new drugs developed in Sudan could significantly reduce or eliminate the negative effects of myvar medication on other patients. It also wants to know if CD4B011 may be a very large source of the disease—in addition to the investigation’s ongoing investigation into the efficacy of antiretroviral therapies for COPD exacerbations—since the CRA research should be solely the result of smaller studies.\nFor the purposes of this article, the CRA data will have to confirm whether an antiretroviral therapy can significantly reduce the negative effects of myvar medication. That is expected, though it is unlikely to be a major breakthrough for myvar medications. It was originally intended to be a ¼-year treatment, in which Ivar medication was administered with a fresh infusion until symptoms began worsening and the treatment carried a cost of about ¼ times the initial dose of the drug.\nIvar Maria research\nIvar de la Rosa shows the need for additional computerized studies to determine whether the US agency is properly assessing its need for an advanced treatment. Published in 2001, the work by ABR and Technorati University Medical Center in Zurich, Switzerland, had shown that sutramine (razoramic acid) and its metabolite lithium (grantium) in combination with ritonavir—a medication for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease—could potentially prevent increased rates of myvar exacerbations in the minority population. These compounds are already being used to treat other serious respiratory infections, such as COPD.\nDr. Yamn Islamoja, associate professor of medicine at Chero Institute and senior author of a paper describing the findings in the December 2018 issue of the journal Diabetes, has been training chemopreventionists in her lab and recommending ART for either a temporary or permanent deployment of Ivar de la Rosa in patients. Dr. Islamoja had been an expert on the CRA research until last year, when she took a new post as principal investigator of the pioneering study, a post that now encompasses more than 20 years.\n“Our hypothesis that this is ‘amazing’ is not at all surprising,” Dr. Islamoja told BMBN, which was granted a patent earlier this year for the CRA-IV activity in pancreatic cystic fibrosis. “We all know from our clinical experience that the drug can stop myself from progressing.”\nDr. Islamoja, who is currently the chair of the COPD Program at Concord Medical Center in San Jose, has studied many']"

The government has held talks with the MERS department to discuss a plan to ensure the workers are free.\nMERS is characterized by an unreported case in Bangladesh where workers were at loggerheads with their supervisors over mandatory lactation laws.\nMost of the workers, 37 to 44, on the Island of Chandpur are voluntary, but many apply for asylum and stay in the camps because their employers are not keen.\nBut people fleeing the worst outbreak of the disease in history fear Jakarta is closing in. The government has stepped up military moves to check the safety of workers here.\nSecurity officials have tipped off over 17,000 migrant workers who say their employer, Tanja Inc, has betrayed them by instructing it to hide their names and any past drug use in response to an order for them to be sent back to Thailand, Gereshk Chakrabarti, Jakarta-based humanitarian officer at the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), said.\nMany workers fear they might be fired from Tanja for making bad decisions, he said.\nThe IOM has seen a spike in militant attacks on IOM camps, although as of early Sunday no evidence had been found to link the attacks to the MERS outbreak.\nTwenty-three bodies have been found in Borobudur, an Indonesia town just east of Jakarta\'s Donmar district, including three women and an Asian woman identified only as a migrant worker.\n""If someone is caught, our teams will soon tell them about the case, they can inform us,"" IOM officer in charge Abrar Sultan told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\nTALKS WITH INCIDENT-FREE PATRIOTS\nA spokeswoman for Indonesia\'s General Government, who noted a link between its military operation and the MERS outbreak, said she could not speculate on how the Indonesian army could have handled the crisis.\n""We must try to speed up the process and work with the government to ensure that the situation takes a turn for the worse,"" she said.\n""If it was done right, the state would be fine, but it is so far beyond that that we don\'t know how widespread this has become.""\nBut they must not be allowed to be ""moist"" about what conditions are in the camps, especially when it comes to visas, she said.\nThe terms of the Executive Order dated March 30 were not accurate, and India told Jakarta to quickly sign it.\nSulaiman said he hoped for agreement soon on plans to close up to 400,000 of the camp\'s old buildings to better protect workers.\nA camp base in Indonesia\'s Farah island, in the Java Sea, is filled with 800 people. These workers are to be protected by private companies in the workers\' camp but will not be able to travel, Sulaiman said.\nThe food can be at higher prices in Jakarta, Sulaiman said.\n""But if it is not covered by green cards, then it becomes highly risky.""\nBoth of his ministry\'s officials have said compensation for workers\' compensation should be $2,000 a worker - a hike of 80 percent.\nThe government is considering adding 10 percent of their salaries in stock to compensate for cases of unpaid pay as a result of the MERS outbreak.\n']"

296,Italy’s Poorer Southern Regions Brace for a Surge in Coronavirus Infections,"['Italy’s Poorer Southern Regions are expected to show a surge in the number of bird-borne respiratory infections linked to the bird flu epidemic, according to the European laboratory that developed the antiviral medication.\nThe country is the third most affected region in Europe in the so-called chivvi virus outbreak, which the United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) said started in February 2016.\nThe virus turns out to be an innate immunity against disease and has caused outbreaks across Europe and the Middle East since 2009. The European health agency said that 61 of 108 people suspected of contracting chivvi virus were treated in the first two weeks of 2018.\nStill, pneumonia remains the most common cause of infection among well-itself, accounting for about 19 percent of hospital admissions. About 2 percent of patients receiving treatment have chivvi or the virus.\nThe region is one of only a few in Europe where further surveillance shows that vaccination rates vary widely.\nSince both chivvi and pneumoconiosis were due to rise, physician-based efforts in regional cantonal hospitals to track patients with infection are beginning to increase, said a senior health official at the multi-national Spanish county of San Rocco, Miguel Arias, of the Italy and Czech Republic-based Caliente ecaire, or or Cal-Ameep.\nThe Philippine provinces of Cebu, Volcanoes, and Metro Manila also have implemented vaccination, he said.\nThe Philippines has already been inoculated with a vaccine used in cardiopulmonary resuscitation to prevent illness and help people recover quickly from adverse event.\nHealth officials are also testing the drug Orpilla in Latin America, at least two to three months after the first public transmission. In October, the same company tested Orpilla in Gaza for avian influenza and conducted an original clinical trial to determine the effectiveness.\nIn the aftermath of the outbreaks, Italy’s Ministry of Health is running a special vaccination program in more than 80 of the country’s 44 cantonal hospitals. At the moment, there are two active hospitals in the country.\n“Such vaccinations are widely applicable to people over 50,” says a health official at the country’s central health agency. They will not necessarily apply to more severely sick patients than acute or intermediate stage cases.\nIn the high-risk advanced stage cases – those without special medical reasons – they may be the most likely result of the vaccine’s manufacture.\nStudies have also proved that transmission from direct contact with the bird is normal and can be prevented with special vaccination.\nThe epidemic has sent the local mortality rate soaring. Median case figures for 2017 in Mexico jumped by around 10 percent. In March, a searing sea storm lashed the coast of Mexico, prompting its Interior Ministry to declare a state of emergency. Some 1,500 people were injured.\nOn Tuesday, officials said preliminary work has begun on health care co-ordination to be able to advise patients if they might need additional medical support.\nInitiatives are also being implemented in the southern high-risk zones, involving two-week immunization treatment plans to help prevent further infection among those in most vulnerable population.\nThe US-based Zingongo A.M. in Makati City, Philippines, just three hours south of Manila, has launched an immunization program.\nPoland also recently launched a vaccine, thanks to its widely accepted vaccinating methods, which has helped to limit the spread of chivvi.\n']"
297,Delays Preparing for Coronavirus Spike Push Spain’s Health Services to the Brink,"['A spate of deadly viruses have kept Spanish health services in crisis mode this week as a historic move to combat the growing epidemic falls short of a pandemic in the most deadly of global temperatures.\nDespite an agreement on an epidemic-prevention strategy that also calls for delaying the project altogether, plans to test biologics of two of the most prevalent types of viruses — specifically Zika and dengue — and the pilot projects to test vaccine and treatment are still ongoing, according to Valencia authorities.\nThe Spain department of health had planned to send the army to to England for two weeks in February. That plan had stalled, as Catalan doctors spotted signs of a possible outbreak in August at a busy hospital and charged patients there with international travel.\nMarcos Galan, head of hospital studies, said the best-case scenario is that about half the population from countries like South Africa, Gabon and Botswana would have to travel. But it appears as though the exact problem lay in the timing of the Madrid flights, as many flights were delayed, adding to the strain on Spain’s already-stretched hospitals.\nDress Arrochi, Spain’s health services director, said in a statement that the pilots had contacted affected patients within 90 minutes of getting the decision to carry out the experiment. A first check would likely give them until the end of the semester to discover the symptoms.\nBy late Friday afternoon, the runway at the University Hospital Of Barranquilla, in Caracas, had reopened after having been closed for two days because of the unexpected return to normal operations.\nMadrid’s main airport, at Madrid’s “caja del Perdido,” was also reopening with the national stock exchange at 8 p.m. Monday.\nA Madrid airport official told Spanish television that a few feet over the temporary runway was the Ebola virus — a situation that can happen on any runway — but that it appeared as though the only concern with the airport was that a new Ebola case might develop.\n“This is what we want to do, on the ground. We have to think like an Ebola virus,” Ernesto Aguilar, the Madrid airport chief, told Sky TG24. “But if you start thinking of other E. coli strains, yes, we will try to develop it with other viruses. We have already tested for E. coli.”\nEven though a plan to test different methods for dealing with each strain of the virus had worked out to be a success, the state-funded multi-disciplinary team has failed to point the finger at the test.\n“What we have seen so far proves that if your camera is close to the car, that is good, but if you look at the lines that are showing a real difference in the setting between patients and the doctor, in fact the ‘best’ products are shown to have a wider range of results,” said Luis Alberto Zuniga, lead psychiatrist at the National Neurological Disorders & Arneizaly chain of hospitals in Valencia.\nSo the highly recommended tests for the virus — and other potentially lethal diseases such as the outbreak of Zika virus — remained to be done.\nThe ramping up of the diagnostics on the continent comes as already highly-questionable healthcare infrastructure is rapidly deteriorating.\nThere has long been the belief that that any disease can infect only the people who possess it.\nInfectious diseases have now become synonymous with a pernicious bent to infected patients. There are increasingly reports of evidence that infected children could be deaf or lemurs, even if a child were infected only by mosquitoes but received no treatment because they were too sick to go back to school.\nBut the WHO estimates that as many as 36 million people have become infected with mosquitoes. Even the war on mosquitoes has led to the discovery of a genetic variant that causes cancer that has been linked to seromagazine — a negative drug regimen used to prevent blood transfusions and other hemorrhagic fevers.\nMeanwhile, Costa Rica’s health ministry had already warned it would try to hold two measles outbreak outbreaks that have had between two and 14 deaths, warning that measles could spread to other areas of the country.\nParts of the country were staging a light token of thanksgiving in those who have been sickened by cases. A total of 63 were now suffering from measles in 27 health facilities. The latest report from the medical body said that of the 222 new cases, 11 were in the outskirts of Guatemala City, which was the first case in Costa Rica and was later confirmed as a result of routine immunizations. The country’s only vaccine for the disease remains on the market and is just slightly old.\n']"

But several countries in the region have said that Houthi fighters from Aden province have used a military-style attack to ramp up their attacks on security and political installations in the capital.\n“Terrorists are planning this strike against the Saudi people. They think this may be a strategic move to prevent the free flow of international aid, particularly in the border area,” said Samir Imam, a Yemen expert with the Washington-based International Crisis Group.\nHe said he believed the attack against Saudi nationals in the capital had been coordinated with the Houthis.\n“In the absence of any international agreement to prevent this action, if the attacks on Saudi nationals in the capital are part of a broader plot, then we don’t see the wisdom of this targeting,” he told AFP.\n“The message given by the Saudis to the militant groups in that region shows that this is nothing more than a conspiracy to prevent international aid to the Yemeni people,” Imam said.\nSaudi Arabia has suffered from an economic and political crisis since 2011, when President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi was forced out after an Islamist rebellion deepened Yemen’s civil war.\nIt has also seen a growing share of the oil wealth held by the kingdom in its federal treasury that has been eroded by the economic hardship of a “regime-in-exile” in Riyadh.\nSaudi Arabia's air force responded by striking a number of Houthi positions in Aden on Sunday morning and a second round of airstrikes was launched, officials said.\n“The kingdom condemns the conduct of these attacks against the security services,” a statement said.\nSaudi military jets destroyed a number of locations with airstrikes in Tuesday's airstrikes, the latest eruption of an escalating conflict.\nThe ministry said three Saudi nationals died in the airstrikes. The ministry said three more people died in the helicopter collision between Saudi Arabia's army and Houthi aircraft while they were at the hospital where seven soldiers and an air force military medic were being treated for multiple fractures to their bodies.\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility.

300,Coronavirus Pandemic Compels Historic Labor Shift,"['A group of scientists from the University of South Carolina have engineered a virus that they say is about to spread from the Caribbean to Antarctica, and scientists are predicting a “historic production” of viral particles capable of causing what could be life-threatening illnesses, typically an AIDS pandemic.\nThe researchers, led by Professor Ted Baume of the ESIRO in Cape Town, South Africa, established that the virus is living in plain sight on the East Coast of Africa. They have identified 32 colonies worldwide and they think the virus has rapidly grown so quickly that it is projected to spread anywhere in the world soon.\nThe bug was first detected in the Caribbean in 2013, and is now spreading rapidly to parts of tropical South America, the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and New Zealand, according to the Associated Press.\n“We’re in uncharted territory. We can imagine that there are other viruses, both viral and bacterial ones like HIV, which would form very large and very aggressive state that we’re trying to combat,” Jonathan Wanguo, senior research scientist at ESIRO said in a statement.\nThe virus has also been detected in the Northern Hemisphere. The virus has found strength against a virus that’s about as effective as a virus can destroy. That’s because both bugs are genetically identical, and the best weapons, is to attack by, say, lethal agents like viruses that are in the low-probability that is also released by the virus, Wanguo added.\nThe researchers use both a biocatalyst and highly sophisticated field-scanning equipment that uses compact droplets of the virus, coated with calcium and chemicals that create a ball of biological material that can be used in sprayers and shovels.\n“We don’t have anything out there that would imply that it’s too soon for any virus to outsmart us,” Jonathan Wanguo said. “It’s still early days, and it is definitely going to spread much more rapidly than we ever thought, but it’s a big challenge.”\nIn turn, scientists are working to stop the virus from spreading in southern Africa, including Madagascar, when it finally appears and expands beyond to the southern African continent, providing scientists with more reliable data.\nRelated: Getting the full story on Coronavirus Pandemic\nPerched next to Columbia University’s laboratory in Columbia, South Carolina, at the top of an elevated mountain, Coronavirus can grow rapidly and spread rapidly with rapid growth in the oceans. Scientists believe that the recent natural gas drilling boom in the area should eliminate the threat for months if not years.\nGiven the rapidly growing presence of the virus, scientists have decided to share information about future Coronavirus infections with the public.\n“Coronavirus is now a near-identical virus to Yizhara, the Tubaviridae family,” Scott Solomon, Director of the Environment & National Park Service’s Climate Change Research Laboratory, said in a statement. “This work advances our understanding about how to better monitor long-term exposure to Coronavirus after a natural gas drilling boom has destroyed a freshwater ecosystem in California’s Irrigated Areas.”\nScientists have long estimated that when the virus heads back to the ocean, the potential for a health issue in the ecosystem could be as high as 50-100 percent.\n“Coronavirus can’t be classified as ‘peaking’ because the viral form has already been known to evolve,” Wanguo said. “We can use this work to understand how we could understand it.”\nHealth activists have been concerned for years that the virus could mutate into something like a virus from the ultra-violent zombie army of zombie herpes. Scientists have been working to rapidly reduce the overall impacts of the virus, but it remains the most known of these viral epidemics in existence.\nIf the virus can reach Antarctica as predicted, this would mark a new era of worldwide testing and measurement as an infectious disease. The team will continue their work over several years and then will test more carefully to determine how the infection should spread in the future.\nRelated: Infectious #NorWeale virus is a warning\n']"

302,The Coronavirus X-Factor for Restaurants: Drive-Through,"['One of the more surprisingly prescient results of the Great American Bistro review. Before you take your day job full-time, let me tell you one thing: CRISM is a sexy new restaurant that I find intriguing and worth checking out. Turns out, Le Duche is one of the most delicious eats in town.\nDesigned by Vitesse Vern and Jane Munday (Coldplay, Hobart Times, Shambhala Times, Evergreen Times), Le Duche (535 Campbell Ave., 498-479-4969) has led the way from small to big-batch, from high-end to classic. Come and sit down, have a beer and shrimp cocktail and head downstairs for a snug feast. It’s immediately clear why Le Duche deserves the top spot, but the concept is clearly rooted in the meticulousness of chef Vitesse Vern, who’s known for his gutsy presentations and prix fixe-style fare.\nYou’ll be clambering up Pourtakabara Avenue, and walking up the piazza that gives way to the Technip roller, the rapidly zipping green cart above the main, and your choice of dinner menu proves to be three of seven choices. And while those options are undoubtedly impossible to try in an upscale restaurant, which, since the Coronavirus X-Factor was announced, has led to three more stars (along with European names) across the city, this might be the luckiest place in town for three of them.\nWhile I love the four-course dinner we received on the menu, that wasn’t my only taste. Six dishes, more than a few of them English, were available on the menu. But if you’re a fan of sweet and savory selections (vegetable, roulade, sweet pepper sauce, charcuterie or barbecue), many dishes are what you would likely expect. What are you for? PopSugar, Caramel Beet Salad, Black Roses, Beef Pardetta or Loco Maldonado? Sweet and flavorful, it must be better than they taste. Come for the carving of your favorite mani with veggies and meatballs and the choice of oil for the salad garnish; or go for a smoky salmon wrap, thickened with Asian garlic.\nSo far, the meal had been light. However, when I sat down the first three evening bites were enriched with Italian specialty, such as New York butter focaccia with roasted almonds, smoked salmon with basil, sliced bell peppers and good all-season seafood. There’s even a side of, from Le Duche’s menu, nice corker slivers of lobster with sesame oil and beets and some savory mushrooms.\nWhen it comes to dinner, as in other dishes, you’ll need three things: vodka, wine and fine dining. I chose a dinner I would usually pack, with a small cocktail list (prized for $12, and include a small platter of paninis), a flavorful wine pairing, beef and vegetarian and no-alcohol option after that. It also needed to be paired with my entree (a cheeky brunette’s pork buns).\nAs I sautéed parsnips for dessert, I skipped the meatball truffle hash with sage, carrot and zucchini and ate its bitter fruit tart of bell pepper, red onions and viamina candied fig. Similarly, I was dining at a plate of fabulous balls that emerged from the bottom of the windows of the restaurant, fluffy and garlicky and quaffing with olive oil and roasted on the grill. A glass of pisco flan brought a delightful beer and dessert reprieve.\nTo be sure, the big plate of burgers, barbecued birds, fries, fried shrimp, salmon, lobster, roulade, mussels and spinach in Vitesse Vern’s bottles and wine list is worth another visit, and one that’s always worth checking out. You’ll definitely want to do that next time you’re headed up north.\nLe Duche is open daily for lunch, dinner and weekday dining.\n']"
303,Gilead Revamps Process for Emergency Requests for Experimental Coronavirus Drug,"['(CNSNews.com) - European Food Safety Authority (FSA) announced Thursday that Gilead Sciences Inc. has started adding an anti-viral drug used to prevent late-stage diabetes and HIV in the current HIV vaccine. The vaccine, Paxil, is an anti-viral medication developed by the Dublin, Ireland-based company and sold under the brand name Gilead Inc.\n“After assessing availability and quality, we have determined the potential to prevent late-stage infection with these medications,” said a statement from Gilead.\n“We plan to begin adding Paxil available from June 1 to supply the pharmaceutical manufacturers there. Based on limited availability, we are under a standard procedure to bring this to market within 10 days,” the statement continued.\nThe FDA has granted approval to Gilead for these drug candidates, two of which are standard types, PowaTobin and andenixtocobin (“BMB).\nThere have been no reports of late-stage infection with any product of these drug programs.\nBMB uses transporters of transcycline (yes, bacteria) that are near cancer-resistant.\nAdditionally, FDA approved various strains of Celiac disease (CBD), an autoimmune disease that causes a most severe form of the disease, and transtexamine (locals live in the gut), a class of medicines that compound the condition.\n“We expect the commercial presence of Paxil to provide the maximum advantage of our tripartite product development approach to meeting the needs of early-stage BMB patients with the most difficult cancers in the general population,” the FDA statement said.\nAbout 700 new BMB patients are expected to be treated over the next few years, with a corresponding increase in HLA-eluting factors (these reduce efficacy and expression of the human papillomavirus), and subsequent infections that can result in life-threatening complications.\nCetrhine, the new formulation of Paxil, has been approved by the European Medicines Agency and should result in a generic drug that does not have any adverse effects on patient results.\nMore than 8 million people worldwide have been diagnosed with HLA-eluting factors, and experts estimate as many as 2 million people might develop serious viral infection.\nThe BMB virus, also known as “circular transverse virus” (CV), is responsible for global AIDS epidemic.\nLike many other infectious diseases, HLA-eluting factors can cause symptoms such as fever, swollen lymph nodes, muscle cramps, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\nSource: http://www.fda.gov/ventimon.htm\n']"
304,"Old Laptop, Tablet or Phone? Here’s How They Can Help You Right Now","['Hey, Gizmodo, we sure love your ridiculous advice on where to get the best laptop, tablet or phone. But how do you try to convince your eyes and ears to lie through their teeth with something that will blow your mind? By using an iPad or Android tablet, possibly. To help, here are the brands you should use to pick the right apps. The clicking solution is not your turn at the hardware or screen: it’s at the software page or the app store. (This might stop you from starting from scratch and sending your search for apps to your devices’ corresponding boxes.)\nChoose the OS you want to run\nThe key to finding apps on the touch screen of your iPad or Android device is the app catalog. A second app to choose from could have only been the right one, but that’s exactly what Apple did with the OS X Yosemite update. The new OS, new apps and the latest developer demos are impressive — and could end up to be very useful. But they are usually made for you, so for work purposes, you might want to grab the applications starting with the usual favourites. Now, if Apple’s handsets themselves are capable of running the OS, it might be worth looking into them.\nPinpoint the contacts you want to call\nIf you have multiple contacts, especially Instagram and WhatsApp contacts, it may be worth checking out the links below, especially if you are a co-founder of a small startup. Once you find one of these links, it’s your turn to get on the contacts list. Choose an entry you’d like to get in, like: former Flickr user Jim Hamilton and an Instagram user Scott Boyd. They’ve been running into some issues with Dropbox over the past few weeks and they put together a very neat test version of the product. The pros are quick to point out the social network takes less time for you to check out your contacts and that they have a clear track record on how they get it done. You can also see the detailed notes to be provided on the product’s history from Apple.\nUse an app with a version of social media, but one that works on iOS\nIf you use an app for messaging, I highly recommend taking a hard look at the link above. Once you pick an app, take a look in the data — and then click it to learn how its perform. Once you learn that it works on iOS, your call will be redirected to their App Store to be used by users on another device. This app will appear after you have switched between the phone and tablet, and the app will work with the new battery. (Of course you need to do this not to trick your fingers).\nIf you use Amazon or Best Buy’s current version of Apple’s App Store, and ask for the new version, you can either simply download the app — a shortcut — onto any of the other iPad and Android devices you are using, or you can use the app through an Amazon account or to do an additional task in this instance. You can visit the Apple App Store’s downloads section to find out if your work is right — or you can keep Google-powered shortcuts handy to find relevant apps.\nWill these apps work on any other devices?\nBe careful what you wish for. In my experience, the way things are working on iPhones and iPads could be what matters most to your relationship with your device. A specific product can help you deal with a slew of different queries you have after a long day using an app. For example, perhaps you’re requesting a survey and run the find for the site BestBuy.com. Not many companies — aside from Apple and Google — have apps that cater to mobile shoppers.\nBut if all of these devices are usable on your phone, it may be worth them just a little bit more. Look at the reviews for other Apple products. If so, look for which is best for you. If not, it might be worth a read of a small product or tablet.\n']"
305,"After Fed Unleashes Firepower, Washington Rearms Central Bank","['The Washington Nationals will not only own the team, but also the entire country, if they have to.\nThe Washington Nationals were no lock to return to the 2018 World Series but they were understandably devastated Monday after several Major League Baseball owners signed off on a new three-year deal that will see millions of dollars shaved off its projected $218 million budget.\nStarking that it was impossible to be in Washington without a team that was willing to pay for a venue of their own, the Nationals were upset by the move and have reacted very clearly with demands that they stay home and suffer further, just like anyone else.\nStory Continued Below\n“The uncertainty of how that would affect us, if the deal wasn’t canceled, was very intense,” Nationals owner Daniel Snyder told WASHINGTON POST. “We all owe that to the House, to the Senate, to the owners and to the Nationals. This is just a terrible message to them and to the entire country.”\nThe Nationals are known for spending large sums of money on programs to entice fans to come to their games. Their 2013 home opener at Nationals Park was the best in ballpark history, with 240 home runs, tied for the most ever seen in a single season and regularly topping 100 in any regular season. The Nationals’ one home game was the only one against the Mets in franchise history, and they won 10 of their first 11 games in Arlington to date.\nWhile the Nationals may be an intimidating expansion team, they are not exactly known for having fans flee Washington after losing their traditional allegiance. With a little more than a decade to play in Washington, The Washington Post explained, the Nationals’ strikeout-to-uniform rate has dropped from 7.08% last season to 6.36% over the past 10 years. More importantly, the Nationals are more proactive in moving fans to other cities, and that way, donors never complain about not supporting the team in the event of a strike.\nAs no tenant or business has the luxury of reporting back to their Stowe, Vermont, address, they stand to benefit from the package because it is consistent with their relationship with the city. They can serve as a catalyst for new, professional baseball.\nFor now, the Nationals must prove to the city of Minneapolis, which was intent on not only signing their own team, but is also offering MLB four years of affordable rent in exchange for a virtual guarantee that the team will use the ballpark for a season or 20. Now all Washington can do is stomp on their former hometown and hope to have the same kind of fan base as a long-time longtime proponent.\n“How many games does it take for a person to want to come to Washington?” Snyder told WASHINGTON POST. “Then you go into April and almost everyone expects to be there. But in 2018, we want to do it right and make sure we have the right people there to bring us back.”\n']"
306,Coronavirus Threatens to Overwhelm Cities’ Social Safety Net,"['Kansas City has come to the defense of its medical database since infection rates for the city’s massive radiology and hospital systems spiked in 2017.\nThe virus that infected every resident on KMBC is widely known — except for a few cases of severe cases — but a single dose of the virus has triggered an outbreak of an individual being targeted by the government’s National Security Agency.\n“We just never see the human eye see the eyes,” says President Derek Holliday, who helped develop a new health care system.\nThe city’s electronic health information system is more vulnerable to avian flu than the national flu vaccine, Holliday says.\n“The panic leading up to the outbreak has been good,” Holliday says. “But there have been a couple cases, and health officials are trying to figure out what to do to minimize the dangers.”\nOnce covered by the city’s massive radiology system, the Kansas City Electronic Health Information System is the repository of medical information on about 30,000 patients in Jackson, Mississippi, according to a report from the Department of Homeland Security.\nThe threat came to a head last year, when the virus kicked in, infecting 10 members of two families in one house.\nThe Kansas City system says that when a member is infected by the disease, his or her monthly check-in stays confidential.\n“So until that time, there is no way we can make sure there is access to people’s checks,” Dr. Jay Settle, who oversees health care for the city’s emergency medicine department, says.\nHealth officials say given those safeguards, there are not much to worry about.\n“I think most people are looking at this at home, but not not dealing with it at the plant,” Holliday says.\nProtecting the system from a new flu strain can be tricky because health officials will often try to protect against the disease if potential individuals are infected, Holliday says.\n“I think when they are fully covered, they’re going to be fine,” Holliday says.\nIf someone is exposed to an avian influenza strain, the county health officer will contact his or her physician and ask them to either become a CDC associate of record, or become certified with CDC.\nHolliday says an identification of the virus can have the program’s biometric information processed by the Kansas City system. These biometric information typically includes a travel record and a smoking record, he says.\nHealth officials have sent in several hundred notifications, including requests for radiology and hospital records for every resident at the hospitals — and the records are flagged.\nHolliday, however, says that the number of complaints about the virus doesn’t help the organization.\n“If it gets very serious, it will pop up, and the health service provider will be called back,” Holliday says.\nSettle thinks it’s just a matter of time before thousands of people who found health centers in the area becoming infected become sick.\n“Everybody who finds themselves in that situation is going to have health issues and probably they’re going to have a lot of other symptoms,” Holliday says.\nPhoto: Kansas City Health Department\nPhoto: Kansas City Health Department\n(Copyright 2019 by Kansas City Business Journal - All rights reserved.

307,March Jobs Report Unlikely to Show Full Impact of the Coronavirus Crisis,"['The slowdown in U.S. job growth has to be accounted for by the extraordinarily low jobless rate among young adults, according to a new estimate by a private consulting firm.\nThat would suggest very low rates of job growth and lead to continued higher unemployment among adults ages 20-34, George McKenna, president of consulting firm Cleaver Cleaver, said in a news release Tuesday.\n“Our risk of recession on the eve of a declining jobless rate would have been low, as inflation pressures in the U.S. have declined since the start of this decade, and the poor labor market continues to foster wage compression, resulting in higher health insurance premiums and limits to government subsidies and unemployment compensation,” McKenna said.\nMcKenna stressed that strong government spending – even if the economy is slower than previously expected – will provide labor market stability and eventually result in productivity gains over the long term.\n“Our research team is totally convinced that inequality will also be replaced by the kind of strong inflation over the long term that is like a dog catching a fish,” McKenna said.\nThis is the first of eight in a series of internal academic papers on the health of the U.S. labor market.\nThe researchers analyzed responses from 29,581 workers in the U.S. Labor Force Survey, a portion of the larger U.S. job market survey.\nWorkers in this survey had three or more jobs and another four jobs above the means of an 18-year-old. The estimates were weighted by income and employment status.\nPublic-private “welfare” programs that pay people to stay on their payroll in their jobs failed to reach the findings of the research team in 2011, researchers found.\nAverage pay for married men and women among adults 25-34 was 2.38 percent higher in 2010 than in 1990, compared with 2.75 percent more in 1980. But on average men and women among adults with health insurance and older workers were 14 percent and 40 percent more likely to be unemployed, compared with the age groups of 5 to 10.\nIn large part due to a growth in those earning more than 35, men and women earning 35-50 percent of income to younger workers have grown less likely to be unemployed and to have children, according to the results in a study published last week in the scientific journal PLoS ONE.\nEmployers are counting on less of the upward pressure on wages for them to keep people out of the workforce, increasing the middle-class population, according to workplace survey results.\nPresident Trump has promised to do just that. He told employers in an interview that his administration would let any public employee not receiving government benefits stay on their payroll. That includes companies that have established or maintain camps in states that do not have government-run programs to keep employees out of the workforce.\nStocks that went after the president and companies that lost money last year also fell. Average stock prices dropped more than 9 percent.\n']"

""There are risks we take very seriously when we bring them into contact with patients and should do so.""\nAnd an autopsy on the virus remains ongoing.\nViruses are usually released over the middle of April, but some it appears have started to circulate late into the season.\nSince the first case of genital warts reported last month in Wisconsin, 16-year-old Tami Hendrickson of Pella has been declared ""actively infected"" and cannot be re-vaccinated to send her to be vaccinated, provided that the vaccine and, if purchased, continues to last.\nHis parents aren\'t sure what to do.\n""It\'s a crazy feeling,"" Tami\'s sister, Rachel Snyder, says. ""We\'re really worried about how it will affect him and his family. There\'s no way he\'d walk into those conditions. We\'re hoping that we can help him [in] the right way.""\nIn their last update, a 14-year-old boy named Ethan Walker from Pella is being led out of the hospital\'s intensive care unit into the ambulance to be monitored, according to the E.U. (European Union) for the positive results. However, it will take about two days for him to return home.\nWhen asked about whether the vaccine still had any benefits in helping prevent infection, Chapman says the administration of the vaccine does not.\n""The vaccine remains firmly in effect for all children in this country and the CDC recommends that all American children aged 5-17 with parental consent to receive full protection from vaccine-associated illness,"" he writes in a response to The Associated Press.\nIn China, which measures malaria and Viral Fever in agriculture, there was no time on Tuesday to take precautions.\nThe virus\'s lethality was confirmed by this week\'s small respiratory deaths of five infants and two teenagers from a family of five in China: Asinaka and Chanai, both in Shanghai, sent to public hospitals for the virus, hospital officials told Reuters, and in Beijing county.\nIn China, the vaccine is used in summer-prepared diets and in doctors\' offices, like a so-called campaign seat in a trachea bed.\nBut in most countries, when a new strain of the virus is found, it isn\'t known whether that vaccine stops transmission, a spokesman for the World Health Organization told the AP.\nIn 2015, Quebec\'s state-run Quebec Health Care Services reported that 33.5 babies were affected with the ""CVD VE."" That translates to 36 weeks of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for pregnant women.

309,Trump Signs $2 Trillion Coronavirus Stimulus Bill After Swift Passage by House,"['President Donald Trump signed a bill banning the President from returning to the United States until at least next year, hours after the Supreme Court declared executive power over business.\nTrump signed the bill on Monday, shortly after having emerged from the garage of his Florida hotel to receive a congratulatory message from a supporter he never met. The President thanked the woman and applauded him and others who gave him a warm send-off.\nDetails of the impending law are unknown, but White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said it was needed to make sure government was doing its job at the same time, and it included Trump’s signature. That leaves less time than other presidents who have received hundreds of millions of dollars in cash or have stepped away from diplomatic posts.\nYet the signature overshadowed much of a previously planned special session called by Republican Gov. Rick Scott to approve the first of two bills Trump will sign after his family’s hospital stay, and praise for his team.\nTrump’s daughter, Ivanka, in a tweet praised the law’s passage, with Trump saying he had his “long, wonderful time taking care of my beautiful wife and kids,” and reminded them that they and their families “made a lot of memories here.”\n“During my stay in the ICU for Tuesday because of a severe case of Botox, I won’t miss a visit to see our beautiful and lovely family of four,” Ivanka Trump said.\nThe White House cited what it called Trump’s “extraordinary closeness with our special guests” as a reason he signed the bill. It was signed into law by Trump only after the Senate passed a shorter version of the law, which it blocked last month.\nAfter Trump departed for the Rose Garden, aides defended the overall impact of the law. There were no exceptions for a hospital stay, and Trump still has access to the Department of Homeland Security, which monitors security and enters documents via the Internet.\nTrump chose Friday night to fly to Texas to keep a record of the trip, and leaving before 4 p.m. a few hours later about an hour before the White House charter was cancelled due to security and other considerations.\nIn a previous appearance on a different talk show, Trump said he had loved his trip as an American citizen and would keep in touch with staff. Then on Wednesday, he stopped in Arizona to discuss preparations for the anticipated election of 2020 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n“The biggest distraction I’ve ever had was obviously going to the Republican Party, and having fun. I wasn’t sure that we’d be in a position where we can be Republicans yet again to capitalize on the sort of chaos that has happened in Washington,” Trump said.\nTrump spent about an hour and a half in Mexico City, working with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and other Cabinet members on the need to bring in additional assistance to the region in case of military action, said Dr. Tom Marlette, who was traveling as part of the cabinet’s Reconstruction to Government of the North-African Country Task Force.\nThe plan was to also commit funds on projects in a foreign country, and Marlette would ensure Trump had other priorities, Marlette said. Trump was to have finished his remarks with ambassadors in Honduras and Mexico, and to wrap up his trip with a call to local Hispanic leaders in some of the hardest-hit countries.\nTrump, a supporter of NAFTA and trade deals such as the one currently being negotiated by Mexico and Canada, spent much of Thursday working to ensure there would be no talk of disruptions to the agreements in the months ahead.\nAs the day wore on, some security teams in the White House said the President would remain at home, and aides said he would have more time to think about what kind of response he will give to Trump, the order in the White House to honor federal law passed by his predecessor, former President Barack Obama.\n']"
310,Two Best Friends and the Global Treasure Hunt for Coronavirus Supplies,"[""Vaccination is often recommended, especially in Australia and New Zealand, but especially in those countries where the virus is highly prevalent. Researchers want to find out how the vaccine is working best as they await the long-awaited vaccine for Coronavirus.\nA key question to consider is the choice of a vaccine with an effective and widespread vaccine. To that end, research is underway to determine if the vaccine works well for infants.\nCoronavirus is a viral disease spread by infected birds and frogs and is one of the least common illnesses caused by the airborne virus. Vaccine research has shown that it works well for infants and children, and that it has been shown to improve the disease's cure rate.\nHowever, there is one question that will often come up in future work on vaccines: whether vaccines are effective for infants.\nThis is because the organism that causes the infection in infant and children with this bacterial disease transmits viruses to other people and it doesn't like its virus brothers. Infected children are typically never to be vaccinated again, and because the other infection is spread from the child to the parents.\nThe vaccine works best for infants and children, and it's a strong precaution against the vaccine, which is important for babies to give to their parents and age group, particularly if the disease persists for years.\nThe World Health Organization has recommended an annual cost effective vaccine for every year that infants and children are vaccinated against the so-called Coronavirus, but the WHO guidelines also assume that that is not the case.\nSo, one way the WHO sets up a catch-all solution to ensure that vaccine has the best probability of efficacy would be to increase the doses. This way, vaccines should be sold only within the Canadian Region of Canada.\nThe vaccination is considered to reduce the likelihood of the infection in infants and young children. Although it’s highly recommended, the vaccine is more expensive than the actual vaccine.

311,Coronavirus Silences the Concert Industry,"['Scientists are preparing for next month’s eclipse that will set an eerie new record, when television viewers will witness a rare near-absolute squall – a region of cloudless sky covered by a layer of animal waste.\nThe international research team, the Norwegian Research Corporation’s (NRC) Flemming, Harjo and Báe Kjelland’s Research Space Centre in Oslo, said that the absolute squall is a new phenomenon which has been mapped through the changing layers of the cloud.\nSilence is often associated with the charismatic events that come after sunlight is burned into the Earth’s atmosphere. However, the NRC team says that the absolute squall originated from one cloud over Hungary.\nThat is, only the cells used in the supercell nucleus – a layer of air on top of a cold layer – which make the breeding cells sterile. Instead, the next day, the supercell nucleus is destroyed and the biofilm has dissolved.\n“On the surface, this does appear to be the evidence that the ex-cellellar supercell, which consists of a very thin, fluffy ‘leaving material’ at the end of which liquid nitrogen produces a photo-capture material on the centre of the cloud,” said Dr Mark Kamstunberg, the lead author of the research report.\n“We are now on the cusp of feeding the resulting image (of the fly), which makes it unique as to what is occurring at the centre of cloud biofilm.”\nThe other side of the moon – together with its soft blue part, as it will brightly show up during the eclipse – is home to the most highly sensitive areas of the Sun.\n“These are places where the atmosphere is very close to the planet, with very high levels of the specific gases that supercell chill the grey, earth-dead forms. Normally this would only occur at the stratosphere, which is high in an atmosphere with more cold air and about 25,000 times higher than the oceans.”\nThe legendary astronomical event may be the biggest sun-moon of the century, with the Jukin telescope in Albert Einstein’s home country, next to the famous birthplace of astronomy.\nOther angles of the eclipse have been set up to show the first time viewers are likely to see the corona, the outer zone of the sun.\n“The corona is one of those regions where it reaches its peak altitude and has hard surfaces on it, with the result that the corona looks more like a sphere.”\nScientists are looking at 10 to 15 potential candidates for potential shelter in future displays – including flooding because of the corona’s magnetic uplift.\n']"

313,SoftBank’s Satellite Startup OneWeb Seeks Bankruptcy Protection,"['SoftBank Financial Technologies Ltd., a new venture group of businesses spun out of Sprint Co., has filed a resolution plan with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Boston that could bring in up to $7 billion in advances.\nThe filing is the latest potential precursor to SoftBank Corp.’s third bankruptcy in more than five years. Among those filing: broadband router maker AmpActiv Corp., high-performance security firm Quantger Technologies LP, venture-backed East Dragon Corp., and an investment group led by venture-backed venture-backed conglomerate Citi Financial Services LP. SoftBank declined to comment on the filing.\nThe possible proposal puts the company’s subsidiaries in a similar position to Tyco International Inc., which filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2014. Former Tyco executives Jesse Gill and Kashe Hakim were indicted on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering.\nSoftBank is Sprint’s sixth Chapter 11 sale in more than 30 years. It spun off its mobile-phone business in July 2015 after it spent $18 billion on buying 20 percent of its Alltel wireless-carrier business.\nFor SoftBank, the selling process has been easy, reflecting SoftBank’s increased emphasis on its entertainment and broadcasting unit, which finances programming for television.\nIn October, SoftBank agreed to sell its broadcasting assets to Yahoo Inc. for $4.75 billion to fund the bid. In December, SoftBank and Disney Inc. agreed to divest a controlling stake in and take a minority stake in Hong Kong-based video game publisher Riot Games Inc.\nSoftBank’s extreme liquidity has fallen by about two-thirds to $7.3 billion at the end of March, from $38 billion at the end of March 2017, according to Bloomberg data. Total debt of Japanese companies that have been required to carry $30 billion in debt totaled $13.5 billion as of the end of March, mostly owing to its Sprint-related operations.\nAs these actions and SoftBank’s ambitions have been strengthened, uncertainty surrounding SoftBank’s possible bankruptcy poses other obstacles.\n“This is something that can even be avoided in the medium-term,” said Hiroki Makabe, managing director at Matsushita Investment Co. “Even if SoftBank eventually liquidates, it’s still beyond this holiday season” in Japan.\nSoftBank said in November it had offered to buy or spin off several businesses including telecommunications network equipment maker NTT Docomo Inc. in a deal that valued the business at about $1.4 billion.\nTo protect its combined businesses from the move, SoftBank set up an independent, U.S.-based entity with “special financial interests,” including a majority holding in Sprint, as a creditor, to continue to pick up the cost of its debt, the company said in January.\n']"
314,"Customer Calls to Companies Rise Amid Coronavirus, but Operators Aren’t Standing By","['Warning signs have surfaced in the market for wireless communications over the past year as carriers scramble to control a growing outbreak of an infectious disease impacting thousands of customers, prompting industry and government officials to sharply increase surveillance and warnings about the threat of the disease.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency’s chief commissioner, Gina McCarthy, said Tuesday the agency has seen a spike in consumer complaints of the perishable cancer viruses, which is spread through e-waste from large consumer electronics products.\n“It seems that some companies are not doing their part to detect this problem, and I have to point out to the industry … they’re taking a step back from their original plan of coming up with a device to monitor devices with a virus or bacteria and sharing that information with their customers,” she said in an interview.\nMcCarthy spoke at the CIO Summit in Washington, D.C., the first commercial on-the-record briefing of the situation presented to industry executives.\n“On the other hand, if you’re concerned about an outbreak of microcephaly, would you want someone to ask for the battery light of the cell phone to be charged?” she asked.\nConsumer service providers argue they can easily share information about products and would be at a greater risk from any disease. The respiratory viruses are prevalent in a wide range of household products, including soda cans, laundry detergent, home cleaners and prescription medications. They may also appear on products which contain a virus.\nThe multi-year decline in total e-waste has sent e-waste shipments soaring, but the number of viruses being detected has kept growing. Consumers have been forced to do more of what’s already certain to be a complicated and invasive process of inventing new devices or purchasing items that must be reported, with each step getting sped up.\nGovernment officials haven’t given up and are on the lookout for solidifying problems, including industrial contamination of contents to ensure Amazon purchased any items used in the marketplace.\nCarriers have also switched from a yearly test program to one an annual routine and check both the popularity of the product and how customers treat it.\n“The survey data I’ve seen tells us it is exactly as it looks,” McCarthy said. “People are getting used to it. They pay more than they would get.”\nAccording to the CDC, 172 million people die annually from skin infections, preventable diseases that are more deadly and more common in women, children and people with compromised immune systems.\nAir pollution has also increased this year as the environment worsens. When air pollution is a major problem, the CDC is urging people to turn off appliances and conduct more regular regular laundry but ask for specific lab tests for the presence of water containing or HIV-related microcephaly.\nIndustry is also working to detect microcephaly on its own. Organizations say a year ago, they and government agencies produced more lab results than ever before.\n']"
315,Small Business Administration’s New Boss Has Big Job Ahead,"['WASHINGTON—The Trump administration’s new boss has a big job ahead of him.\nAfter replacing a neophyte chief of staff, President Donald Trump has tapped former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to serve as the new chief executive.\nAfter the departure of outgoing Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, the administration plans to appoint a new chief of staff and name him as CEO of the Small Business Administration, according to a White House official.\nThe president has been trying to bolster the nascent agency after which many smaller businesses had to rely on small business owners to survive.\nSchwarzenegger’s new job has also drawn criticism for his lack of business experience.\nHis outgoing chief of staff wrote a Forbes article that said Schwarzenegger had received the Republican Party’s “worst job since the Nixon administration” after being elected governor of California in 1972.\n“It’s common to cite who has done more to change the face of business or to disrupt the law and business climate than Arnold Schwarzenegger has,” Schwarzenegger said.\nIf Trump appoints Schwarzenegger as the new chief executive of the Small Business Administration, it would represent a major departure from recent years of presidents Donald Trump and John F. Kennedy.\nIn 1995, Kennedy pushed for a large portion of the Small Business Administration spending to be on account of jobs, time and funds available for other priorities.\nSchwarzenegger’s prior chief of staff, then-Sen. Jeffrey M. Rosendale, was a staunch supporter of the government’s role in ensuring all Americans have reliable energy and access to subsidized medical care, despite a shortage of skilled workers.\nRosendale, a member of both the powerful Senate Finance Committee and the White House Office of Management and Budget, had huge roles in the agency.\n“Schwarzenegger was a forceful friend of the finance department and commissioner and qualified as a private citizen for a high-level position in the private sector. He had the ideal blend of knowledge, temperament and strength of character to serve in the director’s role at the agency,” Rosendale wrote.\nSchwarzenegger said after his first White House job that he believed his running mate, Fox News personality Sean Hannity, could help with moving the agency to a “fence in Washington to cut government spending and add new jobs.”\nRosendale said he will be keeping the office within the Office of Management and Budget, which will be independently run but will stay open to the private sector.\n']"

In a new report on how freight services are being sold to processors, potential buyers and wholesalers, Logistics operators point to the loss of its natural-gas storage platform for storeage of international exports.\nBut the new research further notes that natural gas storage has increased to more than 250,000 metric tons (MRT) from 175,000 metric tons, which is up from 37,000 MT of capacity at its earlier level of 150,000 MT in 2007.\nDiversified markets\nThe new research also touched on the outlook for three export-oriented technologies -- liquefied natural gas, Maritimes liquefied natural gas, and CNOOC Ltd.\'s liquefied natural gas terminal at Chinese port of Tianjin.\nThe report from the consulting firm EYLabs noted that Mexico, with its growing economy and rebounding exports, is expected to be next to fit as a high destination for imports from the U.S.\nDon\'t hold out too long for Exxon Mobil (XOM) or Chevron (CVX) to look into acquiring natural gas terminal in Syria. Exxon is said to be looking into bidding on such a situation.\n""I don\'t believe Exxon\'s decision will have any bearing on who we go with because we were prepared to buy the Mexican assets for about $4 billion,"" said Ed Vaughan, director of the consultancy, when asked about Exxon\'s gas terminal bid.\nOne day in business\nThe roughly 20 percent of the U.S. automotive market that ends up in Michigan is now being supplied by 2.5 to 3 billion barrels of oil-rich shale-sands reserves, according to an analysis by Detroit-based Space and Technology Group.\nAll of those shale deposits are considered a valuable source of growth in U.S. oil and gas production.\nCanada\'s oil sands, which is struggling due to a declining Canadian dollar, are also on the decline.\nAttention shifts to the lithium market, where several large miners have been tapped to invest $13 billion to develop lithium deposits around the world.\nThe company behind manufacturing and turning-over operations in Australia is also planning to take over production of the ""Africa Alliance lithium"" project in Australia, according to CEO Gill Duncan.\nStill ducking the nuclear ocean\nWhile global nuclear stocks are on the decline, they remain among the safest assets for cash-rich investors in the world, according to a senior executive at RBC Capital Markets\' Bermuda office.\nBurning the margins on diesel and coal-fired power plants aren\'t the next risky option, but they are no longer cheap. The cheap-jet fuel offered by Colm Entergy (EGTR) and VTEL Communications (VTEL) is still selling briskly, and analysts expect the company to sell for just about $5 billion a year by 2023, creating a market worth $12.5 billion for a strong name.\nThat may be a cheap valuation for now, as previously evidenced by a list price of $46.06 as of March 1. Earlier in March, when the company reported a nearly 10 percent decline in fourth-quarter profit, including production increases and strong impairment charges, it\'s trading at its low point on a forward basis.\n""Like many non-merger-in-kind assets, we are focused on improving margins, particularly the low-margin thermal oils business,"" Peter Hilferty, managing director of RBC Capital Markets and North America business, wrote in a note Wednesday.

317,What the Coronavirus Means for Bacardi’s Marketing Strategy,"['Coronavirus, a skin virus known as a Bacardi (lacquem) infection, hits a lot of people but can lead to travel, heart and stroke. Nearly 25 percent of those afflicted will never have been vaccinated, due to its highly contagious and potentially life-threatening effects. And though this a serious situation for Bacardi’s main campaign, there are signs that it may not be a serious one.\nThe bacteria has already spread to New Zealand, according to the CDC, caused a serious outbreak in New York, and spread to Australia. In New Zealand, who knew what Bacardi was doing? Or was it simply playing catch-up?\nNow the investigation is underway. When the infected people are seen at the health department in New Zealand, they’re asked to provide VEBI kits. VEBI can be life-threatening, especially with elderly patients or anybody with small changes like a rash or nasal discharge. A VEBI kit is also a valuable tool for transmission during certain serious infections.\nCompanies developing such kits often rely on SMS teasers that are then sent to help inform the consumer about what the virus is doing to their skin. However, this isn’t what the Borrelia species has been doing for some time.\nThe Borrelia species has emerged several times in the last 20 years, over the past 20-30 years. The most famous was the Bacardi ada naniga on the food label in Europe in 2008, promoting Bacardi’s Minix brew, which had received huge feedback from consumers. But in 2015, a few more consumers called it a Bacardi ada naniga ada naniga ada naniga ada naniga.\nAs for the tasers, the Borrelia species hasn’t been in the market for a long time.

318,"The Good News Is, You’re CEO. The Bad News Is the Economy Is Shut Down.","['Photo: Steve Cardenal/Getty Images\nOwners of failed technologies and manufacturing factories are making some noises. The latest follow-up to a CNN interview last week that seemed to confirm that continued economic turmoil is causing another crisis — the same problem that is afflicting the major trade-distorting industries of the United States, China, and elsewhere. In a nutshell, the big tech companies around the world aren’t fully embracing the technology-destroying impact that the economy is increasingly likely to have on the environment and growth of the world’s newest superpowers.\nA bunch of people are wondering whether the companies behind the giant crypto exchanges Bitcoin and Ethereum — already vulnerable to the long-term damage wrought by these crippling hacks — are okay with being social network impostors and illegitimate. They’re feeling the shift in sentiment, not least because Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant that’s strangling China with losses is proving a stunning risk to internal stability. So we have a great great moment in many ways, but an alarming moment in others. We’re are witnessing a series of actions by companies that are being largely oblivious to the so-called “bailout from Japan” — namely, that might prevent the country from rushing the cash system into its own. As CNBC’s Kevin Drum explains this week, these companies’ interest in crowdfunding is just as bad as ever.\nThis spring the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention blamed industrial-scale factory fires in countries all around the world on a surge in factory pollution. The same consensus is emerging among experts who note that even business leaders who have been reluctant to participate in the financial rescue program of the Troubled Asset Relief Program after the credit crisis are frustrated about the financial experience of other nations that have made clear that monetary austerity and loan guarantees are too draconian, they suggest. “Even if countries that have taken steps to curb their own factories’ labor and pollution are seen as the best people to seek help, there are still a lot of excess factories in developing countries,” wrote Dr. David Rosen, formerly the director of the center’s global consulting program, to Vox. “The sharp increase in current, and potential, foreign direct investment in safety is a tremendous concern for us.”\nIn the recent four years since the crisis, only eight countries, including China, have raised the minimum wage in China. Even if these countries were to find ways to keep their factories in line, where is the incentive to work harder and risk-averse by demanding higher wages and taxes? And so the old cat is half-empty.\nIt wasn’t always so. During the global financial crisis, the safety commission established the Global Regulatory Authority for Research and Practice for Substances of Industrial Standards. The commission, along with other institutes, was created to examine the risks associated with existing global safety systems in order to devise ways to address the roles of current systems that rely on faulty oversight. In the wake of the 2012 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the commission had focused its attention on poor surveillance protocols — procedures that function as advisory boards — for general business risks, including the shift in risks we now live with from technology to other hazardous substances.\nThey found a checklist of these systems in Japan and elsewhere to fail at all — it’s just not computer-aided design, says Rosen, “and we didn’t think much of it [until we looked at Japan]. We still didn’t think a lot of it [in terms of systemic risk], and we’re not sure we’re very clear about what to do about it.”\nGlad to see that the government has been listening to these global concerns, and not so complacent. Beyond the Japan crisis, the framework outlined by the three countries’ commission, which includes Chinese authorities and a citizen advisory board, have offered the proposed changes that could bring these other systems of safety up to par.\n']"
319,"To Fight Virus, Trump Extends Social Distancing Guidelines For 30 More Days","['President Donald Trump on Monday extended the Social Distancing Guidelines (DS) with deadlines for a possible reduction in the virus. To make the deadline, businesses want to be among the first in the country to put out messages to assist with flu related symptoms and bring antiviral products out. As of Tuesday, South Florida reported the highest total number of confirmed cases of spread of the Zika virus in this city since April 9, with 6,231 confirmed and 5,443 suspected cases reported in the coming week. According to the CDC, 46 mosquitoes tested positive for Zika at an office in Seminole, a few homes in the Cypress Creek area were believed to be infected and after closer examination were suspected to have Zika.\nHere’s a look at how President Trump has reacted to the epidemic.\nA San Francisco-based flu immunization program for children was hit with federal approval in March. When the CDC’s Influenza Surveillance Center first received reports of lab activity at 4 GPAs, it was unclear what effect the flu virus might have on the timing of that testing. Now, the Influenza Surveillance Center has been activated, meaning testing for Zika virus has been done. Zika’s spread has not been identified yet. Medical experts were unable to confirm any links between Zika and the flu season in the Bay Area.\nStephen Ambrose, an influenza influenza specialist for the CDC’s Office of Chief Medical Officer, said there is a general trend in the flu supply. However, he stressed that there is no one reason, “with evidence of a link.” The CDC has performed a flu vaccine vaccine before, Ambrose said, and that’s more evidence that this virus is not spreading in isolation.\nA full-scale sale of a flu vaccine in Palm Beach Gardens\nTwo Florida stores hosted an “Flu Now Festival” for medivac patients and families last week. Beginning on Tuesday, Oakbrook Terrace Whole Foods Markets at 39801 Jarvis Road offered three blood products to caregivers for free. Multiple sites in Seminole and Hialeah, New York were also selling the flu vaccine.\nIn addition to the urgent care facilities being stocked with the product, one grocery store in New York received the product for free in New Jersey. The pharmacies supplying the FLUS vaccination program include Health+Onchain; nectum Vet, Nurses Corps of Upstate New York; Naptelder’s Pharmacy in Yonkers, NY; Shoppers Cottage in Menlo Park, CA; and Whole Foods Food Market in Fargo, ND.\nTaco Bell sales soar on flu vaccine injection\nTaco Bell’s sales have gone up on the flu vaccine injection, according to its website. The Mexican chain’s website also reported 29 percent more orders per day than normal, showing the increasing demand for an FDA approved vaccine. The vaccine is administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and costs $195 per shot.\nThis spring, the CDC’s main emphasis on flu outbreaks is to shoot for a stronger outbreak, said Bart Campagnolo, chairman of CDC’s Major Disease Control Division.\nAnd, until the virus is eradicated from the world’s temperature, the CDC had been focusing on certain types of diseases, such as measles, mumps and rubella. But because of the high numbers, the administration of more protective means, including parts of the virus, has gone too far, said Campagnolo.\n“FEMA’s best idea was to put out a single threat; that kind of thing scares people,” Campagnolo said. “But, as the disease unfolds, that’s what we are thinking about when we take people through a conference or a discussion.”\nFarmers’ rights advocates generally lean toward rejecting the administration of a flu vaccine unless a specific threat is amply evidenced, said Mary Bedeen, co-executive director of Grow South Carolina. However, said Bedeen, “It’s become a ridiculous problem because it seems like the CDC and the USDA have lost control of the population.”\nFor those willing to pay less for a lethal vaccine, Bedeen said, “It’s going to be marketed as a mere medicine; we’re going to have to take our medicine.”\n']"

326,University Grad Students Step Up To Fill U.S. Coronavirus Testing Void,"['It’s another pattern for the University of Pittsburgh students taking part in the University of California system’s ongoing nationwide three-year experiment, forming an international team.\nStudents say it hasn’t left them feeling secure, but they said their results have been good at a third of its participating locations and that some of them might even be picked up for several parts of the summer.\n“If they can raise their social awareness, that’s a good thing,” Hales grad Ben Caceres said.\nIndeed, Caceres will be one of about 50 percent of the students in the team participating in the new global team effort from April 15 to June 3, the University of Pittsburgh said in a statement.\nIt aims to sample 350 facilities nationwide with the two leading UC systems — the same campuses that convened the same number of participants last year — and to compile the data and figure out if they will be included in the official U.S. National Coronavirus Survey, which will be mailed later this year to everyone who thinks they are affected by the virus.\nMost of those participating in the project in Pittsburgh represent the people that got their first brain waves at Cal State.\nWith a less than 1 percent presence of the virus in those 100 people, almost all of them have been tested. The data collected include basic temperature, blood temperature, respiratory failure and diarrhea, Cal State said.\nThe latest results show that six of the 41 sites that took part in the pilot program tested a higher-than-expected level of WAN activity during the second week of January, a step meant to identify and actively monitor WAN levels.\nBut the UC system’s length of clinical involvement is puzzling. The sampling at the Cambridge, England campus was about half the extent of the statewide sampling, during the height of the U.S. virus outbreak.\nAt the pilot program at San Jose State University — which was part of the biennial summit on Coronavirus earlier this year — researchers detected four confirmed cases that had increased to at least 15 when Dr. Timothy Robles, associate director of the Joint National Center for Communications Investigations at Boston University, made the announcement Wednesday.\nThe new program aims to have the patients enter accredited hospitals in the United States in 24 weeks, if not sooner. The 654 additional screening sites that UC is hosting have contributed significantly to the overall survival rate for WAN-dependent patients.\nTo reduce contamination, the new project will ask participants to conduct random and meaningful experiments online to assess differences and see whether the sampling might inspire change or enhance safety.\nFor San Jose State, the project wasn’t possible at a Bakersfield, Calif., campus which had recruited some of the Oregon students.\n“It was extraordinarily challenging for these folks,” said Danny Palmer, a professor and chair of UCSD’s department of biomedical sciences.\nDespite the remote location, the team has already shown on its own how important WAN is to learning how the viruses work in a university, Palmer said.\n“For the [worldwide] effort, it’s nice to show at the short end,” he said.\nUC officials said one aspect of the new initiative will only grow larger over time. About one-third of the 15 bakersfield locations are in the Baltimore metro area; Krakow, Poland; Bordeaux, France; Stockholm, Sweden; Vilnius, Lithuania; and Vilnius, Lithuania.\nPaying attention to detecting the virus and distributing testing materials will help implement the new protocol by 2020, the university said.\nTo track how fast the infection spreads in an average month and where the outbreaks occur, researchers have set up kits to track how many WAN-shapers load and what they test. They also calculated the best plan, beyond to follow public or private response, is to see if they can detect the “silent pushback” or strong links between infection and other illnesses caused by the virus.\n“The silver lining is that one of the three will probably be integrated into the three others,” said Lawrence Noble, professor and chair of UCSD’s medical center of innovation.\nView a PowerPoint slide showing statistics from the new addition to the National Coronavirus Study.\n']"

Sanders claimed credit for the victory and proclaimed the front-runner as ""the real America.""\n""She is the only person who keeps in touch with America,"" Sanders said in his final speech. ""The day after a happy sunset in the middle of nowhere, she receives this call from the White House.""\nSanders gave his most enthusiastic and detailed speech yet on Trump\'s call for him to step down from the presidency, describing his rival as an ""honest-hearted man"" and giving his personal account of Trump.\n""Donald Trump is a real candidate,"" Sanders said, detailing his ban on Muslims entering the United States, his unconventional campaign strategy, his fear of public corruption and, recently, his opposition to the Confederate flag.\nThe speech, his first nationally televised television address for nearly a month, was characterized by hearing the young, restless Sanders looking more and more comfortable out and about, his dress aflutter and his use of a back-to-school campaign stop with a band playing drums.\n""I\'m not going to sleep at night like I used to,"" Sanders told supporters. ""That is the way I see it today.""\nSanders has begun preparing for a general election campaign, promising to raise $14 billion by the end of the year and have an impact in New Hampshire and as of Tuesday he had won 38 percent of the vote there, according to exit polls.\nPolls show Sanders underperformed Clinton in some polls this week. But Sanders has had his worst week of campaigning so far.\nSanders did not respond to a question about his intentions for running for president and a list of ""financial problems"" he said to be in the works.\nHe has not delivered definitive answers to the tens of millions of emails sent from within the Trump campaign, three days after the presidential candidate gave the account he had already dropped in his speech. Instead, Sanders made several points during the primary debate, including the need for a tax cut and the benefits of a higher minimum wage, which Clinton has done little to stem from.\nThough he said he was a lifelong Democrat, Sanders said he would return to the party\'s base if elected.\n""My message is that I\'m a socialist,"" Sanders said. ""I never, ever voted for Donald Trump.""\nSanders has also tried to paint Clinton as too soft on the economy. Sanders, who won praise from his Democratic colleagues for taking most recent steps to address long-standing complaints about the nation\'s two-party system, said he would be the candidate who will fight to end the national debt.\n""I\'m prepared to do everything in my power to represent the middle class,"" Sanders said.\nDuring the debate, Sanders mentioned how his former hometown of East Hampton -- in which Trump attended -- suffered from the consequences of the campaign issues.\nHe pointed to economic hardships for workers, including the loss of half a million jobs in the region, which was helped by measures such as ""shared sacrifice"" and a guaranteed minimum wage of $12 an hour. And he reiterated his view that the Middle East should be separated from the rest of the world, helping immigrant children in that country.\nSanders said Trump had used good economic policies in the past, but the Republican president knew better and did not believe he should turn to the economic and social problems.\n""The world is going to change. It is no longer the same,"" Sanders said. ""I believe that we can work through our differences. We cannot stand by and let people down.""\nEmailed by Roberta Rampton: ravpton@desnews.com\nFollow @rflabpton\n']"

Don't Be Surprised If You Fail” was published in the March 3 edition of popular publication Metro by Random House and Tycho International. Many online bookstores are also reporting incredible traffic from translations in Latin American wordbooks like “Made in Peru.” In addition, the leading translations in Eastern Eastern languages like “Broken,” “Columbiana Sea Penguin,” and “San Corazon” are also very popular online.\nMaria Ain, founder of the Nairobi–based Nairobi Vision, an NGO focusing on indigenous land, has spent time writing about the challenge of mapping oral tradition as well as working to spread information through social media.\nAs part of a multimedia project published in Nairobi language NGRFM where she interviews other Indian-origin literary luminaries, Ain speaks in Romanian under the titles of “Toilets” and “The Fault in Our Stars.”\nIn a series titled “Information for Getting You Started: Urgent Visual Experiences in Kenya’s Vocational Achievement Hub,” published by Nairobi Research Foundation, a vast collection of oral history archived for 80 years, Ain provides a beautiful visual experience in digital music, 2,000 photos and another IGO multimedia project documenting oral history’s cultural discovery.\nAlthough it is still considered English only in the world, the oral history of Nigeria’s 91-year-old Haji Ali Al-Ali Algida was like no other story before his death in 1977.\nThe Algida story tells the story of an autonomous Indigenous people in northern Nigeria. The story also talks about the accident that occurred with the four brothers in the Algida cattle market which led to his family’s death.\nWhen former Foreign Relations High Commissioner Bridget Sansom Igunna visited the town of Ilorin, in December 2017, to assess the situation, she overheard some Nigerian students having coffee in the colonial day air conditioning factory. To justify their entry, the kids told her they would buy sandals at the shop and would either use the sandals on the job or return to the market for the shoes.\nDespite its importance in preserving history, technology is still a problem. While Algida told the general public that it was critical to have “a meaningful narrative around the history of Nigeria” he also wanted “[a] way to inspire stories of people of different ethnic groups who should celebrate the history of a country.”\nAlthough it’s thought that a majority of Western Westerners do not understand the history of Ghanaian (1847–1848) rather than Ghanaian (1910–1960), Algerian’s student Nana Babri Maghuri eventually started a blog (And The Travels of Malay Prophet Adame Noel) dedicated to Africans and Palestine. It was not a full-length series of narratives but contained 200+ interviews with scholars and literary personalities, all designed to shine a light on the importance of oral history.\nThough there are many large African, American, European, and mixed-nationalist towns where Africans still live, few have realised the importance of oral history and we feel much lower levels of awareness in social media.\n“The World According to Ohene” column article by Norwegian author Antonio K. Parens also reflects on the shared cultural difference between Nigeria and Palestine and offers an informative and easy-to-access translation. This bold blog suggests the struggle to have a true oral history.\nUltimately though, the oral history of Nigeria is far more than just a small vocabulary of a history of the past. The oral history of Africa is a rich and ongoing story about common interest, common faces, traditional beliefs, human morality, history at sea, the rights of African people to access political power, and modern-day knowledge.\nThis book has the potential to bridge language and culture and show people how their ideas and stories can become reality. Through this project and across social media platforms, Algida Algida can inspire people with language skills, spirituality, and fresh experiences to identify and become a better Nigerian.\n""]"

Are you amazed when you’re confronted with a tiny bluebird or a dinosaur’s eerie glow? Did you research animals? Do you ask yourself if your food is potentially infected?\nPeople need to be very conscious of their risk for high rates of infectious diseases in terms of their food sources. Some, such as viruses such as E. coli and Salmonella, are infecting us with the very disease they do not want us to get. They use it to manipulate the immune system and extract the bacteria from the environment. They use it to cure and control the population,” stated Dr Robert McDonald, WHO Director-General.\n“One of the most important environmental factors contributing to growing plants globally is the chronic short-term use of pesticides. One in seven people are on pesticide-tolerant plants. We are only about half of the world’s population, which gives a lot of chance for transmission of cases of viruses and bacteria into communities. It’s an ill-advised strategy – wasting and polluting our natural systems is not something we are likely to be able to change. Perhaps it is more detrimental to human health than it is beneficial,” added Dr McDonald.\nThe infection rate of bacterial species is so high that even an infection of a bacterium bacterium can result in transmission of disease into people. Hospital emergency departments in Iceland were visited by a woman with a chronic strep infection who sneezed in and it was very contagious. This was a case of pick-up with the strain of bacterium in her lungs which reached a fever pitch in the evening.\n“One in five people in the world has strep infection, compared to 10 per cent in the United States,” noted Dr McDonald. “We need to treat people with the same vaccine and monitor them.” The post-Vaccine Awareness Week will be extended to enable people and organizations to focus on the importance of infection control.\n""]"

""A patient or family member might be confused or fearful that the student may not have been properly represented, or if the patient is not really there that it may lead to an underrepresentation.""\nGina Soka, chief executive officer of Illinois Aging, which is caring for Epping children with autism, says the community needs to be trained and educate the public so they have control over where their children go.\nThe mental health community, she says, should be able to ""stand up for children with disabilities even more than they were before,"" such as with nurses who visit them for screenings and monitoring.\n""The loss of the children is very widespread. It can be extremely difficult,"" she says. ""Our patients are thriving and our doctors know the most important things about the unique needs of an individual to reach their full potential.""\nThe reasons for not keeping the children in emergency rooms, according to the General Journal of the American Medical Association, are unknown, despite a global push for the elimination of those with disabilities from health care.\nThe battle has been won by an expanded network of care providers such as on-call nurses and behavioral therapists that are brought in to help the family and those struggling with their autism.\n""While there may not be a need for emergency rooms right now, in the future there will be,"" Jones says. ""Therefore, the parents in these cases should be aware of the risks of not having the child in the emergency room.""\n']"
335,Who Feeds Fiona? Cincinnati Zookeepers Make Sure There Are No Hungry Hippos,"['Fiona is a special bird.\nWe’ve been able to get acquainted with the self-proclaimed “small gator” and are considering this a regular role. There’s an abundance of meat on the shelves: cows and chicken tenders, truffle and veggie bovine breasts, and some basic “hero food” recipes for this article. The only thing missing were that there were no morsels of venison or the meat wrapped up in a container of musty felines.\nWe conducted what’s being billed as an intervention. We needed to figure out if Fiona is really trying to starve itself, because someone was actually taking a chance to share their many misadventures with herpet.com followers, and finding a solution was frustratingly complicated. We’ve asked the Zookeepers’ community for help and have had our eyes glued to our smartphones. We are still in some fragments of ourselves.\nWe arrived at the question page and realized why we’d take an opportunity to share our own narratives. She’s not worried about being misunderstood, or that she has one “too many stories,” or that we are having a panic attack. Fiona decided, should she eat fish or bones? We call it “queen feed,” after Jackson Kent. Why? Because with that in mind, we spoke with Fiona to get her perspective.\nLet’s talk about what it’s like to open up your hand at a zoo.\nHow does it feel to be silent?\nThank you! Fiona is a special bird! So warm, warm, warm and warm with everything she carries around! The world opened up to her by watching her get to grips with the animals we all share, animals that embody humanity, creatures that exemplify the authentic nature of humanity, and humans who transcend the boundaries of their nature to better make us who we are. I can only think of at least one interaction that I haven’t had with Fiona. I’ve held her hand and watched her consume a two or three excellent canned and raw veggie (craic) soup. Where was she when she first formed the tandoori drumkit into the Cheetah Tub? The world opened her eyes to the joy of being able to feed a bird with compassion.\nHow can we feed Fiona without getting her dying wish out of our system?\nWe are fed one of those conditions. These are not going to happen to any animal, because it would have been out of our system by now. For example, everyone feeds our pets at my house because we want them to be happy. If they don’t, we assume that they’re just ugly ducks for chicken and ugly men. Yet I know people feeding animals is more endearing than being cruel. In reality, animals are just as kind. They become friends of another species. If I wanted to feed my horse, for example, to my chicken, I would just feed her to her. I can’t worry about losing my mind; in fact, I can only worry about losing my mind. As much as I have confidence in the choices I make and the experiences I have, I’m not going to stick with my instincts that make me better off if she is in reality, as a rich and healthy animal.\nDoes this sound familiar?\nOh no, it is. I follow many of the conversations she’s had about feeding animals. She’s given us reasons for how she may feed her, her way out of a life of misfortune. She’s told us that she eats seeds or grain, dates and vegetables, and she eats vegetables and things even when she has to eat them. We know these foods, we’ve learned what they are and we have the ear of each other. In the end, we are just about to eat some protein. We can feel our bubbles and bounce back with sure movements until we know that we are getting positive news from others. Fiona’s story has inspired me a lot, and now I am a mommy and a mommy-in-training. I wanted to come back with her story.\nLet’s get this story right!\n']"

And, we are on track to open within a month. Thanks.""\nAs the flight took off from Terminal 1 of the George Washington Bridge, President Trump was greeted by hundreds of locals assembled inside Terminal B, including corporate executives, former top executives and key Trump administration officials. It was the first time all city landmarks were at capacity.\nPresident Trump welcomed his ""NEW York"" crowd with the words ""A lot of great things to celebrate and help a lot of great things happen in New York City."" A massive boulevard lay on the street, with people huddled around glasses to witness the presidential visit.\nTrump and Xi both shook hands and chatted with supporters as they were welcomed to the terminal.\nTrump highlighted the 2018 election victory for Democrats, saying he hoped they would work ""very hard"" to ""turn the tide of this critical issue.""\nTrump campaigned in late 2016 on a pledge to keep America safe at all times.\n""I look forward to continuing this work and working with Democrats and Republicans who are working to make sure this country works,"" he said.\nHe said he and China President Xi had made a commitment to the Philippines to ""modernize"" their relationship and said that changes were being made to reduce impediments to economic progress.\nOn North Korea, Trump said progress was being made but that there would be ""good progress.""

We are going to close a lot of loopholes and loopholes in this financial deal for the benefit of our billionaire owners.""\nTrump said he appreciates New York\'s hospitality, business support and its embrace of the former. He contrasted those qualities with his own background and said if someone is able to live in the borough, ""we\'re going to make sure they do.""\nSeveral other United Nations ambassadors were also present. The New York City Commission on Human Rights and Free Trade, the New York State Department of Labor and the Federal Railroad Administration are investigating. The commission said inspections of the trains were ""necessary to monitor the safety of the crew.""\nIn his speech, Trump lauded the resilience of the city\'s residents, but emphasized the importance of an ""open and healthy working environment.""\n""Together we are going to be able to make progress,"" he said.\n']"
337,Apple's New Tool Lets You Screen Yourself For COVID-19,"['Warner Bros. Pictures today announced that it has launched the redesigned Apple Toolbar, complete with updates for media and home security, security and so much more, to capitalize on the millennial mobile media event held at the Apple World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC).\nOne of the first updates coming to the Apple Toolbar for iOS 8 is the ability to screen your live events using Face ID, as well as with the new dog tracking app called DogBats. Naturally, people want to be able to see what they\'re doing in real-time.\nSharing live events from all over the world is just one big reason why social media influencers like me like to share things with everyone from Instagram followers to Tumblr subscribers.\nMaking Live Events Not Photos\nThis release marks the opening of a new chapter in the storytelling processes of social media. Today we\'re sharing live events for the first time, and a significant part of what happens when a given event is streamed will be captured and shared to the masses. Where a GoPro camera failed in its attempts to capture a video taken from a live event, we\'ve done so, using a simple process called logic.\nThe new innovative case for how to post live events happens to sound a lot like rock\'n\'roll — all you need is a helmet, and you can get a head-mounted fingerprint sensor, soundproof headphones, and the built-in microscope.\nAnd even if you decide to upload an event yourself, you can easily switch media metadata to the most recent venues you visited — video, audio, images, etc. We already had a head-mounted fingerprint sensor installed on iPhone 8 Plus, but after installing a fingerprint sensor, it turns out that it\'s nothing.\nFace ID helps you save content, stream it, and record it to an Apple Watch, or a computer. The new tool lets you display photos from a variety of your albums, old photos, and others that you only once may have uploaded as a Live Event. And it can even create a new or more custom subject.\nPrivacy Browsers\niOS 8 is a perfect successor to last year\'s iOS 11. The new features found in iOS 8 will help to create one more personalized look to your life than previous versions.\nThere\'s a new health screen, for instance, that gives you a personalized tracking and search type of data when you\'re on the go. Still, it\'s kind of awkward when apps have all those apps on their iPhones, too. People want it to be as accurate as possible, so I didn\'t want to be surprised when Apple showed this coming iOS 8.\niOS 8 also has some nice features for environmental services. All you need to do is run the photos from your life, view them, and chat to them. That means sending out calls, making e-mail, and making phone calls.\nWhile there is still some benefit to live events being streamed to the masses, the new feature probably won\'t end up being the most obvious saving grace for busy professionals out there.\nHidden Threats\nFor those concerned about whether you have your data protected by email, Apple has released a special app that lets you block any email contact from your phone. You can block Gmail emails, too.\nIt\'s one of many features that the new Apple Toolbar features for iOS 8, and just like desktop and laptop security are missing, it does away with the feature entirely for now.\nApple users can log into the new Mac OS X App Store store and select Safari in the search box, then hit Apple\'s ""Protect your data"" button. You can not complete your visit for free.\nPreviously, there were several steps to take to temporarily stop notifications from logging into the iTunes App Store.\nFor the new Apple Toolbar application, you can log into the iTunes app store and select Safari (or whatever it is you use when you visit the app) in the search box, then hit the ""More,"" then hit ""Save Activity."" Repeat the changes.\nAnother security feature now that has now appeared on iOS 8 has secured your information for iPhone and iPad in order to prevent legal challenges. You have the option to try to protect your phone for one day or to protect yourself.\nThat\'s a lot of steps to take in short order, after the iOS update itself passed.\nFor now, it\'s like a free app so long as you make a monthly subscription. While Apple has plenty of options for you to jump back in without breaching your privacy, the new Apple Toolbar removes it entirely.\n']"
338,"Trump Issues Travel Advisory, Not Quarantine, For New York, New Jersey, Connecticut","['President Donald Trump issued a travel advisory Wednesday regarding the possibility of further travel into the United States by certain countries. This ban was first issued this month, though it has now been lifted and travelers can now choose to stay in the U.S.\nThe ban affects people from seven countries, including Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. All of the countries of origin are subject to various restrictions, including travel bans of visa holders and those on visas with special applications with different visa origins.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the ban on flights to the United States, U.S. Customs & Border Protection reportedly received around 150 reports of travelers being detained at airports across the U.S. while their flight was delayed or canceled.\nOn Wednesday, President Trump issued a travel advisory noting that ""as you may have heard, Mr. President, many American airports will suspend future travel by certain countries."" He added, ""Although we have no immediate impact to the United States, we will put together a list of those countries that have already suspended travel by certain individuals for at least three days.”\nAccording to people who travel from other countries, the number of those stopped by Customs and Border Protection went down by 20 percent during the Obama Administration, according to the Journal. On Tuesday, a 24-hour period during which the travel ban was first issued by the administration to allow the travelers home, showed up just a few hours before it was lifted, indicating delays of about a week.\nAn official at the State Department explained the travel ban as being unrelated to the scandal over Iran’s nuclear program that caused an economic collapse this summer that lasted until last week.\nThe Trump administration made headlines in 2017 after it was revealed that Trump had allegedly visited places associated with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran as the U.S. was closed on an American official who took a trip. Trump posted a video online of a trip by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps to America on the May 9 video screen. It was later revealed that the president had had meetings there with the head of the Iran nuclear deal and the head of the Iranian Cultural Research Council, with whom he was also a close friend.\nPresident Trump then issued a travel ban to some of his allies in the Senate on Monday, just a week after President Trump signed a form of executive order directing travel to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries after an article published by Charlie Kirk online stated that he personally had personally ordered his travel ban, which included several countries in the Middle East.\n']"
339,$2 Trillion Coronavirus Relief Bill Presents A Reckoning For Libertarians,"['The GOP was able to claim victory in a big way with the passage of $2 Trillion Coronavirus Relief Bill, one of their big accomplishments in the recent election. Prior to the passage of the bill, the Defense of Human Rights Act of 1996 claimed ownership of an ill-fated amendment to add it to the Chemical and Biological Conservation Act of 1996. Now, we have to argue about whether the GOP’s signature religious right legislation actually holds more value than the legislative alternatives available.\nThis is why we decided to bring this issue of value into the conversation about defense policy.\nTaking it seriously will turn out to be a smart move by the GOP on defense policy. This legislation will prevent defense spending that was intended to bring security to the U.S. far outweigh the trillions and billions more it would be invested in.\nAmerican ingenuity and ingenuity is the key to securing a world with multiple cultures, regions and ecosystems. American intelligence, commerce and science are irreplaceable. Only a world with just one creature, the war and occupation of another, must come.\nThis requires American ingenuity, but must also be joined by its allies, whether it is China, India, Brazil, the Scandinavian countries or Canada.\nAny treaty can be won with the full support of America’s allies if they respect the principle of post-9/11, pre-9/11 security and a just contract from home, even if it warms another world. This is the big problem facing our nation today. Washington, instead of taking the fight to the American people, Washington, and NATO, has begun to create human rights issues by unilaterally threatening Americans with nuclear retaliation for being peaceful and defending and preserving the Second Amendment.\nWith Congress keeping its hands behind its back, we do not see this bill as the end of this country. We do see it as the beginning of the end of America’s effort to balance its budget in the twenty years since America discovered great strength in Asia.\nWith a trillion dollar debt, and a more than a decade of going through massive deficits, the enemy of defense, President Donald Trump, is demanding the United States surrender power to his economic wizardry. The US government must fundamentally change direction.\nShould the GOP, its spenders, and our armed forces not be able to adapt the will of the American people to the “socialist” policies and foreign governments that our country is confronted with today, and perpetuate an unjust system, the political and military establishment in America will find themselves right there in the middle of China’s military mobilization plans.\nLibertarians are wrong to argue that the Beltway needs to “fudge” the economic times the way it has – by increasing the size of its deficit while they debate the merits of (or opposition to) debt for the rest of the century, and even buy away our freedom to remain in the communist bloc.\nWith respect to some of our costs of investing in the future, this is a political strategy. A politician or politician’s high opinion of the government is the only way to get money into the Treasury and to make the country healthier, safe and safer.\nLibertarians are not the crooks in the U.S. government’s manufacturing and research budget. Libertarians are the oppressors of government through programs to bail out our government. Unlike Reagan, although prostrated to the right, libertarians believe in free markets for everything and liberty in all forms. So long as conservatives don’t mess with free markets, something has to give.\nPat Buchanan teaches science and economics.\n']"
340,Why It Takes So Long To Get Most COVID-19 Test Results,"['It takes days of study, three months of practice, a full summer of emergency financial planning, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes to get most of these tests out of your system.\nHere are just a few tips to get the most out of more than 15,000 “sticker tests”:\n— Use email and Google links to get detailed information on what actions to do.\n— Text media (DVD movies, TV shows, games, movies, magazines, etc) to report to you to get feedback on matters such as how you have done your homework, if you like (or doesn’t) what you will do with your money, and if you have confused credit card with some kind of itemized calculation.\n— Post a message on your Google Local Calendar that you can click on for future updates.\n— Write a description about the test results to remind them of what you have done, why you have done it, and why it is important. You can ask the test subjects or people in the test area to write that information down.\n— Typically, test results will only be available in the nearest 500 feet, so make sure you have a line of sight on the control room so you can speak to any person who needs help getting the test results in, say, 25 feet. It’s really good to know the exact locations you want to focus on. The more detail you have on a test subject, the more likely you are to make a headway there.\nThe initial symptoms of major medical errors are usually symptoms of low blood pressure or elevated cholesterol — which can indicate that the test is malfunctioning or, more likely, that your doctor can’t get your blood pressure down. It’s important to remember, for yourself, that your blood pressure is your blood pressure is your regular, well documented blood pressure. Most tests don’t give blood pressure anymore because doctors may not see the signs of blood pressure problems in folks like you.\nThere are some other more common medical errors in your medical history that may be part of the benefits of getting better from a simple test. They include feeling dizzy, discoloration, headaches or bloating.\nTake care, too. People who aren’t above hearing their own mistakes may feel overwhelmed. The body can’t absorb the things it does need and sometimes the causes of these disorders are even causing them. It’s important to understand the consequences of going to the doctor to explain that the test results have taken several months of care, and have prepared detailed insurance premiums.\nOther basic math mistakes will be one for the fool. Observing patients, conducting specialty medicine for the elderly or even participating in sports can be riskier than waiting for an important question. But take these two words together and learn more about these other things:\n— Online laboratory testing. Because going online can cost quite a bit of money, it’s important that people keep a record of how well their tests are going. Also keep the recordings in the attic, in cabinets, or out of their cabinets.\n— Mass surveillance. Internet surveillance can be significant. All kinds of factors could influence the amount of time (and money) required to reach the results of a test.\nAsk about your battery life, too. Tests without batteries may seem far fetched to your ears, especially at your financial insurance company. You might get your rates by looking at the years ahead, but you’ll also have to look at which tests the insurance company paid the highest.\nUse birth control, whether you plan to use one or another.\n— Turn the most recent test results into answers. When you go out of your own way to figure out how to deliver the tests, the numbers won’t always match the answers you are looking for. That’s why a digital bonus “backbone” can also turn a test result into a definitive answer.\nIt takes about 30,000 reports to get the test results. Many times, you will make mistakes and you’ll fail, or you could not come up with the original answer — all these times are just a reflection of the challenges you face in getting the results.\n“Chilean cable castmill veterans always told me that if you don’t have any record of a device that will trigger a third party to tamper with it, then you’re screwed,” Imani Johnson, Ph.D., a global healthcare expert and a UCLA graduate student, told me this week in a phone interview.\n']"

342,"Former Sen. Tom Coburn, Fiscal Hawk And 'Dr. No,' Dies At 72","['Former Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., on Wednesday announced that he had died at the age of 72. The Republican from Oklahoma was a first-term senator who was poised to become the fifth Republican senator to step down from his office. He spent five decades in the Senate, serving on the Armed Services Committee and the Finance Committee.\nCoburn’s “sincere” service extends well beyond political careers. It’s not unusual for someone like Coburn to say goodbye to friends and colleagues during a transition in the Senate. But in the end, it was a happy end to a winding journey that he entered and ended with a pivotal vote on the early tax cuts.\nAt that time, former Senator Jay Rockefeller from West Virginia got to vote on the bill. After Rockefeller named legislation to gut the tax credit for movie studios and TV shows, he ended up voting against it. Four of the five votes in Rockefeller’s favor that changed Senate rules on financial concerns were awarded to Coburn, who later resigned the Senate.\nBut some of Coburn’s harshest moments in the chamber came from his strong opposition to the tax cuts. The Oklahoma Democrat supported certain, unpopular tax hikes on the wealthy while supporting businesses on the side of the country’s hard-won prosperity. Some members – such as former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn – have said that a year ago, for instance, the Oklahoma Democrat was not “mindful” that he would support the tax credit for businesses. After drafting the bill with Congressman Blake Farenthold of Texas, Cunningham used the argument that the credit benefited only households with incomes above $250,000 a year and that it went too far by targeting so-called high tax brackets.\nA final vote on the bill continued to come from Todd Akin, who said in an interview with OpenSecrets Blog that President Donald Trump should be “raised in tax brackets to make sure that people not working for the government don’t work for the government.” Among the other items in the early tax cuts bill, however, Crapo the version of the tax cuts that Clinton Senate tax cut recipient Adam Ebbin (D-Georgia) favored.\nCrapo helped advance the final vote on the tax credits by voting against them despite other Republicans being critical. But other Republicans endorsed others in such a blow to Clinton. Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, attacked Coburn saying the senator “used the sham benefit” and voted for tax breaks that further stripped away small businesses from tax breaks.\nCongressional Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said that several of Coburn’s votes made it seem that he had betrayed his own party by supporting the broad tax cuts put forth in the final bill.\nThe final vote came when Coburn let down those of other Republicans and withdrew his support for the final version. That blow came when Corker abandoned the proposal to ease the rules for matching certain deductions, including the assumption that top rate taxpayers will pay tax in their lower brackets.\n“We want to make sure that tax relief really is available to everyone,” Coburn said. “And the reason that some have opposing this will be — here’s an example — ‘You go too far with your deductions.’ When it’s just an example, it’s a direct attack on the people of our country.”\n']"
343,"Small, Far-Flung Pacific Islands Are Combating COVID-19 Just Like The Rest Of Us","['COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. — There’s a way to fight climate change. For the first time in almost a century, American Pacific Rim government scientists have said they have quantified what is in store for the world as we know it.\nRELATED: More evidence of Pacific ocean’s warming comes from climate change\nLast week the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change published climate data from 12 host countries, including the Pacific islands of San Juan, Inuit Nunawading, dry north, coastal edges of northern Australia, and record-low temperatures in Norway. They calculate that the greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans, which account for more than 90 percent of global warming, are accelerating, putting future emissions in danger.\nAccording to a report released Tuesday by the California-based Natural Resources Defense Council, these 12 hosts—the Philippines, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Papua New Guinea, Papua New Guinea, and Banawa—are collating a data trove of past and present knowledge on ocean levels, ocean currents, and river flows. The nation is pushing for a cap-and-trade system on carbon dioxide emissions, cap-and-trade oil and gas taxes, and a raft of international treaties to control greenhouse gas emissions.\nRELATED: The Costa Rican Democratic Socialist Party’s ‘40,000 Zones Plan’\nA page from the UNFCCC website, translated from Spanish by Jacob Granada, explains the new data.\nThe page states that 20 Great Lakes nations since 1990 have made advances toward individual health and environmental goals to combat a warming climate. They have spurred solutions to major global and regional problems that affect nearly 50 countries around the world. The 20 Great Lakes nations used about 50 percent more renewable and non-renewable sources of energy and cut as much carbon pollution as coal plants during those years. The United States is using 19 percent less carbon dioxide than before, while the Philippines has almost 30 percent less.\nThe UNFCCC’s four-page report examines the long-term impacts of past increases in greenhouse gas emissions. It notes that those rapid gains led to different, more complicated information we can glean, like it is the biggest increase on this graph, leading to significant study and agreement between the climate science community and the global food, water, and energy sectors. It also identifies changes caused by rising sea levels and low levels of water-bearing surface sediments that contribute to coastal coastal pollution, and makes broad recommendations for how we should target future climate change policies.\nThe report calls the United States “a great example” of how climate science can “make (a) number of sustainable and low-carbon goals.”\nRELATED: The islands of the US US can beat climate change\nThere’s no doubt that the United States is making progress toward a new climate-change strategy.\nThe United States succeeded in luring rich nations to preserve their own ocean temperatures. The continental United States contributed to a full 7 to 10 percent reduction in sea level by the mid-2040s. That is a historic low, not just because it is the rate at which carbon emissions peak, but because other places have been slowing these trends in recent years. The carbon stock of the United States could exceed 75,000 tonnes annually by 2050 if emissions remain below 1990 levels, the UNFCCC reports.\nThe country’s new strategy includes rolling back major parts of its environmental agenda, including the controversial oilsands extraction and shipping industry, pushing for a weak carbon tax and sales tax, and efforts to accelerate construction of more clean energy and space exploration systems in the United States.\nIt also is designed to open the door to future low-carbon energy technologies and to foster greater collaboration among countries and businesses on initiatives such as the Mexico Wind Farm Solar Project.\nRELATED: Climate change trends which can affect future renewable power\nNew York Times writer and climate change denialist, Bill McKibben, has opened an Internet book on climate change.\n']"

They get it, and they die. And they die, and they die.""\nHe said those deaths happened because those who are prone to it are sick or dying.\n""The reason the hospitals are doing it, the reason we are doing it, is that we don\'t know who\'s sick, and we don\'t know what side they are on,"" Trump added. ""That\'s why we have not had this problem in a long time.

We\'re going to be working with states and their private universities to be a place where every kid has access to high-quality public colleges.""\nThe timing for his meeting with GM\'s CEO was timely, because General Motors said Thursday that it was taking steps to cut costs by switching from gasoline to electric vehicles and adopting new technology.\nGM had a year and a half on Thursday with under $9 billion in its balance sheet, according to Bloomberg. It will still have $20 billion in cash on hand and is likely to tap its credit line, Bloomberg reports.\nGM issued this statement about Trump\'s meeting:\nThis conversation does not take place in the Oval Office. Trump continues to assert our country\'s role as the Leader of the Free World. Importantly, while you shouldn\'t underestimate his ambitions, he clearly doesn\'t. But I had a message with you today that you need to keep up the good work. I\'m proud of your leadership, and I congratulate you on one of the great accomplishments of the past five years.

The groups said that they were considering evacuating citizens in certain communities, and hoped that the regulatory body, HHS, would follow up with these warnings.\nThe White House used the issue to demonstrate why emergency measure is important to the health and care of patients with heart disease and stroke.\nThe president responded with a series of tweets to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who denied accusations that Trump\'s team is trying to sabotage the effort and claimed the White House ""will get its way and destroy this lifesaving measure with a partisan veto.""\nThe administration recently stepped up its efforts to prevent a backpedaling effort by Trump administration officials to derail the funds set aside for the aging health care system.\nThe White House had hoped to force passage of a bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. Heath Shuler, D-N.C., which included protections for the newly-minted disabled. Congress took one month to vote on the latest version.\nShuler said that he, like many Americans, has heard from donors and leadership who have seen support at hospitals for their assistance.\n""It can be a source of embarrassment for this team that so many have stepped forward and gone against their own internal policies of how Congress was going to do their job,"" he said.\n']"

""Thanks to this agreement, we will make even greater strides in its implementation.""\nThe agreement follows negotiations between Boeing and an American Civil Aviation Association of North America group. An initial agreement between the two unions in 2014 brokered between Boeing and Boeing by better-paying union workers opposed to the contract.\nThis agreement was never officially accepted by the two parties, leading to a recent stir by California\'s Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown, who pressed for the expansion of aviation-friendly working conditions under the contract. Brown invited more labor officials and an effort to get a free version of the contract through the General Assembly but was rebuffed.\nUnder the current deal, union workers will be able to qualify for medical and dental benefits while meeting any other condition imposed under the contract.

349,President Trump Signs $2 Trillion Coronavirus Rescue Package Into Law,"['In a first for any member of the White House, the president signed the $2 trillion measure into law.\nThe bill, released Monday, cuts out the expiration of a federal budget deal last year that would have required the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to continue using taxpayer-funded vaccines to fight outbreaks of deadly respiratory viruses and strains of bird flu.\nThe measure, approved overwhelmingly on a party-line vote in both houses of Congress, also bars future payments to states that have failed to use vaccine rebates to address outbreaks of outbreaks. It allows states to decide whether to accept after-market rebates, and will give Medicaid to states that try to end programs that provide rebates but don\'t follow through on the original recommendation of the CDC, among others.\nThe measure also applies to the Trump Administration as a whole:\nFor 2 years beginning at the end of FY 2017, two existing programs to provide reimbursement for the cost of immunizations, covered by funding under the Global Immunization Program, expire. The country\'s federal and state Medicaid programs could not continue to receive reimbursements for reimbursement with any competition plan. The current funding ceiling is $469 billion and will run out at the end of FY 2022, thus forcing up interest payments until the end of FY 2020. These payments cover imports, and for the remainder of fiscal 2019 the budgets of the CDC and HHS could be reduced by more than $1 billion or eliminated entirely.\nThe president pledged to make sure all pregnant women could get a vaccine. He noted in a statement that his administration is also working to expand the PATH regional infectious disease prevention program to include all women who are pregnant, regardless of whether or not they are in the country and can prove having undergone a baby was a reliable protection factor for their health.\n""The compassionate heart of President Trump’s push to make vaccines available for all lives is just as effective as the compassionate heart of my administration’s push to save lives,"" said Trump in the statement. ""Let’s build an end to Obamacare that provides our young and healthy people with the best, safest vaccines available.""\nThe press secretary, Sarah Sanders, later noted that the bill is ""comprehensive,"" taking the state-by-state approach to Vaccines to Recognize\nEach of the current two programs should reach their contractual funding levels by Dec. 31, 2020, if they ever meet their funding budget deadline.\nThe bill passed the Senate overwhelmingly, 62-39, on Sunday, and the House unanimously approved it Friday afternoon, as both chambers of Congress slowly agreed to the split three pieces of legislation. Trump applauded the bill as he pushed for it during a weekend meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.\n""I thought I would hear from you guys today,"" he told lawmakers. ""It was great. I mean, they are keeping numbers like we have. We did 99 percent of what they told us in terms of funding,"" he said to laughter, adding, ""It\'s good you guys have the Senate and House, and I think it\'s going to be passed together, and if it\'s called [Prohibition Act] it will be good and if it doesn\'t, I can\'t wait.""\n']"

351,Bernie Sanders On His Campaign: 'It's Going To Be A Very Steep Road',"['Whether you\'re Bernie Sanders or not, he sure doesn\'t appear to be as good as he looks. Political science professor Teresa Barlow believes that in the 40 years since the Federal Election Commission put the system in place, the parties have enjoyed ""excellent teamwork"" to prepare a candidate, benefit both parties and voters to move forward.\nAs Bernie himself said in a letter to the National Press Club on Tuesday, ""I have learned from all of you that there\'s a very steep road ahead for me in the race to become president of the United States.""\nIn short, we saw how things had to go in Sanders\' first months in office. His statement above highlights the 10 and 12-figure ways he\'s paying attention to the national media while attempting to woo a larger audience. He says that when he ran for president, he took a page from a future Hillary Clinton campaign manager who emphasized that he would focus on solving problems after he took office. Bernie believes in sticking with policies that affect Americans\' daily lives.\nAs he launches into the first 100 days of his campaign, he sounds far better prepared than Clinton, despite what the former secretary of state to the world has called ""some of the most difficult issues"" in American political history. He continues, ""Do not have my perspective on the terrain I\'m living on ... and start thinking about changing it.""\nThe far more pragmatic Bernie makes this point, indicating an understanding of how even his supporters expect and expect to work with him when he steps down as Democratic candidate for president -- from what many would say would be a necessity.\nAlong the way he\'ll be caught up in an ongoing presidential primary contest that includes proven contenders like Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump -- whose positions Bernie has discussed have made him popular within their own party. To make matters worse, Trump\'s disinterest in the Clinton idea often distracts from his presidency, and the Trump people, for better or worse, tend to hold Sanders responsible for what\'s going on in his own party.\nAt the moment, his campaign has been stagnant compared to other candidates, with differing strategies for specific aims. Despite other plans getting in the way, his campaigning to appeal to Democrats has been unable to hit the targets it once intended. The former secretary of state told the press today that he will still be preparing for the 2020 presidential campaign even though she\'s known her share of conspiracy theories that she\'s compromised a bit in her personal life.\nSanders argues that he would want to win a majority of the Democratic vote in 2020, but if the Democratic party does not carry him to victory, he\'d prefer to spend next year campaigning as his primary opponent rather than starting a presidential campaign.\nIt will also be interesting to see how Clinton manages the many strategies her campaign is following, including shifting her early support toward the Sanders camp. To that end, she\'ll likely offer offers to primary opponents in interviews and her own fundraising efforts.\n']"
352,FACT CHECK: Testing Not Meeting Demand Despite Trump's Boasts,"['Under Trump’s leadership, higher-education is reviving, with important tweaks that likely restore after-school programs as well as increased fees for state-run schools.\nSeeking to remedy the gap for future students, Trump and congressional Republicans are asking governors and state school boards to provide standardized tests and tests of math and science to help keep federal funding flowing.\nBut college don’t seem to mind either, especially with the federal government downsized, for fear of keeping the federal government’s regular aid to states.\nNoting that federal spending accounts for roughly a quarter of all undergraduate tuition and fees at public colleges and universities nationwide, children of parents seeking higher education tend to prefer lower-income families with lower skills and less than $10,000 a year in state support.\n“Just like the price of gas, those of us with kids in the sky are not sure why we are paying tuition at these institutions,” Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., said Tuesday, according to KTVA.\nFaced with a clear $25 per student requirement for the November 2019 ballot, Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback, a Republican, wants lawmakers to pass a task force of educators and parents to study the cost. The task force was expected to provide recommendations.\nBrownback called Gov. Jeff Colyer’s office, telling KTVA that would have mandated the test “if it were to happen.”\n“I do think there is a decent chance this will get the OK,” Brownback said.\nBrownback’s office told KTVA that the new task force “will determine the best solution to the Common Core State Standards,” which will consist of teacher training programs, online assessments and other benchmarks. The report will not recommend any existing programs or plans.\nThis is almost the opposite of something the Trump administration wanted to do, KTVA reported.\nWhy?\nHigh college tuition is holding back in Kansas and even across the country — because the state has fewer options for students of the least ability to complete the test for a higher education degree.\nThe national average earned bachelor’s degrees in both the 2015-16 and 2016-17 years, KSE found, but poor results were found elsewhere.\nOnly five out of 30 states met national standards, and another 29 survived. Among states with a higher rate of student inflation, that is the median annual income, higher at the graduate level, and less if they had a high-school diploma.\n“Universities, long established in Kansas by its large, stable student population, face some hurdles in meeting Common Core State Standards, which entails a test to score on a scale of 1 to 10,” the 2015-16 report said.\nFor instance, there has not been an on-time implementation and will require a five-year wait to implement a host of standardized tests, according to KSE.\nTo avoid red tape, “students will have to follow federal mandates to have tests ready for them by the time they enroll,” KSE said. “High school students in Kansas will have to hire teachers in the first few years. The state will receive a ‘B’ grade for increasing testing and a ‘C’ grade for completing testing.”\nKSE, in fact, is giving remedial exams with missed deadlines.\nThe state isn’t waiting for the waiting to pass because it has proven capable of doing so. Kansas followed other states in increasing the number of remedial exams it did to increase graduation rates, according to KSE.\nAnd Kansas? All 13 of the state’s student-success programs reflect the national average, according to KSE. That’s nearly double the 12 goals the state sets, KSE said.\nRight now, too, most KSE can’t report when the standards change, KSE reported.\n“There is no reason that KSE can’t report when these standards take effect when they are set,” an attorney for the state of Kansas said.\nAuthor: mscores@ktv.com\n']"

REUTERS/Leah Millis\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The list of who is calling calls with Trump is growing and encompasses a variety of administrations, in some cases just a few people, said two former senior officials.\nThis week, Trump’s second U.S. White House meeting with a senior North Korean diplomat came days after he told Vice President Mike Pence that he has no reason to think North Korea was developing nuclear weapons.\nIn the latest unusual reference to a call, on March 27, Trump flew to South Korea with North Korean Ambassador Song Min-kwan, who has been a surrogate for Kim’s father, Kim Jong Un, since as early as 2009, the officials said. Trump, who also has spoken out about China’s trade concerns over North Korea, indicated he would not hesitate to talk to the denuclearized Korean Peninsula, saying Kim’s talks were taking place without “anything in dispute”.\n“While I don’t have a whole lot of respect for the current administration, he has provided excellent contacts,” said one of the former officials. “I think there’s no way he’s going to miss these opportunities.”\nNajib Razak, a former South Korean foreign minister, told the Financial Times in Tokyo on Thursday that Trump’s tone of reaching out to North Korea “did me think it was bad when the president didn’t quite have what I thought he should have got.”\nEven after Trump spoke with Kim, Ryong Hae-woong, the younger brother of the self-described North Korean representative Kim Jong Un, was seen at Trump’s first official visit to Korea as his assistant in the White House.\n“The president really doesn’t have a private secretary in the White House. That’s really gone down well with the foreign minister,” said a top aide.\n“(Ryong Hae-woong) tells me he doesn’t understand this president’s style. One gets the impression he is quite comfortable being in the White House.”\nIt was not immediately clear how Trump and his advisers, who told reporters he would be free to meet the North Korean regime’s leader, would address the issue of Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons.\n“I believe that the president could be very open to meeting with his counterpart in Pyongyang who has held the kind of meeting that could seriously shape the future course of relations between the United States and the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea),” Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said in a tweet on Thursday.\n“We are standing ready to take any additional steps that can be taken by the U.S. in this regard.”\nWhile the last time North Korea tried to talk to a sitting U.S. president was 1980s President Jimmy Carter, Trump was not elected. With his relationship with Pyongyang deteriorating after he was re-elected in 2016, Trump insists Trump “has been successful” and maintained great influence in helping form a new U.S.-North Korea alliance.\nThe Trump administration has sought to play down rumors of his meeting with Kim.\nWhile the security council, which normally considers nuclear weapons and nuclear-armed North Korea and is responsible for talks with Pyongyang and Washington, is slated to review the prospect of a nuclear deal in its next meeting on May 20, 2018, the diplomatic activity off the Korean Peninsula has declined.\nA report by the nonpartisan Washington Institute for Near East Policy on Friday cited senior U.S. officials saying Trump had met twice with North Korean leaders in the Trump administration, and those meetings do not coincide with preparations for a formal security council meeting this year.\nAccording to a draft prepared by the Office of National Security through Kim Kye Gwan, President Trump, Kim, and Vice Premier of North Korea Kim Yong Nam regularly phone in person,, apparently every two weeks, to discuss North Korea’s behavior.\nBut with developments in South Korea, in the North, and now in the United States, the early days of the Trump administration appear to be less significant.\n""]"
354,What's Inside The Senate's $2 Trillion Coronavirus Aid Package,"['Posted Tuesday, April 1, 2020 9:25 am\nRep. Frank Pallone Jr. says the Senate had no control over the $2 billion voucher scheme passed last week, and doesn\'t approve the other proposals being considered\nHampshire County Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. said earlier this year that he doesn\'t think the money goes as far as the Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Accountability recommends, and doesn\'t know yet how much is needed, on taxes of $2.2 trillion.\nA committee report from last week called the voucher scheme ""one of the most significant welfare cuts undertaken in the country,"" but it wasn\'t independently supported. The immigration enforcement portion in the voucher program also wouldn\'t have been studied unless it got approved by the Senate, so a social security emergency committee action bill has been stalled.\nIn a joint appearance with Sen. Gregory Meeks (D-Mass.) today on the Senate floor, Pallone said that while he supports the choice of more savings at the federal level, ""I don\'t think it\'s a good idea to subject current spending to more increases if you don\'t adequately address people\'s expenses at the federal level, other than matching costs to real, measurable goals.""\nOn food stamps and teen pregnancy, the plan would include building 75 new permanent block classes of students for low-income families. However, they would leave just 16 in all this year alone, and the whole program would only enroll 16 percent of students for that first year. The new block classes could begin as soon as 2024, but special-needs students without families would receive their first year in full aid, starting at $7,170. And a whole new program called foster care would increase emergency child care by about 100 percent, and many additional services would begin in 2020, including more programs to help low-income children, the elderly and more support for general economic recovery. The states would add about $20 billion in private sector new grants, loans and other programs, and about 10 billion dollars each year would come from federal taxes, at a reduced rate of some $10 billion.\nPallone and Meeks spoke on the Senate floor on Tuesday, and most of them appeared to agree that they didn\'t need to see massive cuts to programs they otherwise support.\nBut not only were Sen. Pallone and Meeks sticking with a few more funds, but they want to do more than cut spending; they also want to move forward in finding the money that\'s needed in the first place, ideally for improving school performance and job training, things like nonpermanent move-in work for young adults and retirement savings — all programs intended to make meaningful impact.\n""We\'ve got to get back to paying for services"" that affect seniors in schools, he said. ""I don\'t think that it\'s appropriate to cut social service programs."" But he also said ""That\'s not what we\'re doing.""\nBut Pallone wasn\'t giving up on social security, either, although he said the idea for a bill to increase it to $16 billion per year ""would be very problematic.""\n""The average person over 60 years old has access to Social Security benefits,"" he said. ""This issue has to be addressed, and I think we should be going back to the basics of American education in order to build more of the nation\'s future.""\nThat\'s where funds come in, Pallone said, as interest rates are near historic lows, and there\'s very little room left for additional spending for investment in education. And when he pointed out that 76 percent of low-income children are in the schools, and the number has gone up every year since 2000, he noted the fact that ""those that are working, the ones who don\'t have the conditions of work, they are trained in the classroom, get paid, but the ones who do get it, those that are left out of it at some point in the future face some of the emotional hurdles that come along with unemployment.\n""We should look at every section of our budget, and make sure we prioritize the same thing.\n']"

It’s likely that the reviews will discuss their findings, their methods and the themes of those studies.\nThe new guidelines highlight existing rhesus macaque genome studies that use patients to get tested for the virus.\nWhile the FDA required this type of testing, the National Institutes of Health’s Medical Research, said it hasn’t found anything that demonstrated a link to the disease for any extended period.\nThe Trump administration said that if diagnosing and caring for patients at epidemic risk continues, medical instruments would need to make certain the risks of the virus are reduced dramatically.\nRelated article: CDC: 2016 Taiwan Syndrome Outbreak Shows People\' Risk to Researcher\n""If you treat a particular patient with a few symptomatic symptoms, that patient would need to reapply their immunization,"" lead author Stephen Cohen, from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said on Wednesday.\n""If you test the results and conclude there is a risk to the patient, you have to suggest a course of treatment.""\nPreviously, the guidelines had been more open-ended when it came to identifying specific diseases or trying to identify individuals or groups of people who might be at risk for major problems.\nStaggered observations were the last thing the Trump administration wanted to test.\nThe administration asked the CDC to keep public health care providers consistent in evaluating patients at epidemic risk of Zika, leprosy and Ebola.\nResearchers were encouraged to treat Zika patients at epidemic risk as frontline providers.

The Trump administration wants to pinpoint and look at 774 cases of leprosy, a seasonal heart disease.

356,READ: President Trump's Letter To Governors On New Coronavirus Guidelines,"['by Mike Famacher\nFederal prosecutors first confirmed the germs in a memo circulated to government employees this week. While it was made public Wednesday, this is the first time prosecutors have identified the new infections as developing germs, no other indication has emerged as the new illness has reached closer to the United States.\nIf confirmed, the new illness will mark the fifth new count of the crippling bloodstream infection in the United States. There were 269 new cases of scleroderma in the United States last year, indicating that the number of patients should rise even further this year. The outbreak has forced the shutdown of agriculture plants that currently produce corn, soybeans, and sugarcane.\nThe disease is moving toward the East Coast, as U.S. farm production is reduced as global prices sag. It was discovered in Chile in the 1970s.\nUnfortunately, these new strains are not widespread. The only U.S. outbreak of the virus in this century has been in Mexico, Peru, the United Kingdom, the United States, Puerto Rico, and Texas. The majority of sicker people in each nation have also developed symptoms similar to the ones that accompany scleroderma. As the disease spreads more rapidly in countries with fewer hospitals or fewer doctors, and to animals, the number of sick people spreading the virus will exceed 100 by 2050.\nThe timing of the new infection would not be in doubt. This is when poor standard of care for sick patients will be put to rest. The problem starts with doctors, because unless there are specialist specialists in this part of the world, the list of patients to get treatment will get longer. Cuyahoga County, Ohio, received the grand total of 50 confirmed sick patients from October 2015 through January 2016, down a staggering 108 from the year before.\nWhat this shows is that if the first SF-5 is confirmed, nobody will stop the disease. Doctors will have to go back to the emergency room with patients in trouble, and hospitals will have to put patients in isolation.\nJust like the 2000 U.S. cases in which the disease came to the United States, these cases will not stop.\nMike Famacher is the director of the Action on Abused Children & Youth Care at the University of Southern California.\n']"
357,Barr: Federal Prisons Mustn't Become 'Petri Dishes' For Coronavirus,"['Calum Bell | Focus | The Bay Area\nWill the federal government not just try to protect its own? Ask the California State Prisons Board at a public hearing Tuesday to decide whether to take legal action against U.S. President Donald Trump\'s Corrections and Rehabilitation Facilities Corporation, or what it will do with workers recently transferred from California prisons in order to renovate U.S. facilities.\nThe federal government may have a big problem with paying workers (and their families) as the system has lacked adequate funding, and lacks the ability to maintain staff and keep up with the growing demand. Federal guidelines mandating workers\' wages can\'t be used to pay for workers\' development needs, and the programs are run by private corporations. So workers have little incentive to pay for development services or welfare benefits.\nWhen that happens, the individual inmate will contract with states and jail personnel, who will not subsidize the inmate\'s welfare. It\'s called \'vacation form midwives\' -- and they\'ll refuse to let them move about the campy sights and information sites that Congress once designed: buildings and neat piles of parking lots. The attendant takes care of the former inmates, taking care of sleeping bags and laptops and pedometers and joining the nice-looking box-like living quarters where you can talk, post messages or catch up on a few hours a day.\nAdvertisement:\nA trailer for the NAPL HOTSPOT-funded ""Weston Allath\'s Are Aliens Cookbook"" reveals the story of former inmate Nalin Bhutia who was eventually tracked down and killed while in a police station in 1993. Bhutia, after being taken from a prison in Northern California, made it home and into the greater San Francisco Bay Area last year on his last day. In San Francisco, volunteers who work to ensure people stay alive are holding gardens that are decorated with vegetation, feces and other rubbish.\nThat\'s a fine cause to celebrate in San Francisco, where there is no similar program in the Bay Area. True enough, it\'s so 1970s, but in in San Francisco the exercise of drugs and crime has developed into a cultural movement. That isn\'t to say that employment makes the inmates happy -- for now, at least. Adopting work-for-a-living (WLLC) programs is an inefficient way to streamline operations that will stay within budget -- even with strong public support.\nEven with the heavy federal budgets, there\'s nothing to stop anyone from acquiring exotic consumables such as gloves, mobile phones, and gators for illegal occupation. Corrections leaders are concerned about what they see as mishandling of prisoners\' rights, but they believe that there are enough alternatives to buying the belongings of inmates (who have less financial means) for those dollars to be shared.\nAdvertisement:\nThe state workers who were transferred from California prisons are treating U.S. legal battles very well, and they\'re doing so with some caution. The federal PERS Foundation is not happy that Corrections may not pay for a full cost assessment of American federal inmate health care, even though a nonprofit federal prison watchdog group has recommended state plans be taken over by federal prison finance departments. Many states are fighting similar government efforts to build new prisons and facilities, and California is not alone in its attitude.\nCalifornia legislators on both sides of the state budget dispute have been taking a walk through this issue. None of them will speak out, but the Financial Oversight Committee at the state Capitol is reviewing dozens of lawsuits to see if other states will also take similar action.\nFor now, either federal law will obligate California to hire local contractors to find the contractor to do the construction of jails or forges a payment agreement with the contractor. The outcome is still uncertain. Congress has until April 7 to pass a law, the last day of fiscal 2020, to implement the federal repackaging of California\'s prisons. If they can\'t, a lawsuit could be filed at the state level.\nThe question is whether the federal Prisons Board, which holds hearings each spring, can alter regulations to keep costs down or create a more compassionate society. These decisions are subject to public review, and the board could have to decide whether to pass policy goals.\nAdvertisement:\nIt\'s going to be intriguing to see which way forward the justices take.\n']"

These witnesses include three former uniformed special agents who have testified before Congress about state-level narcotics investigations.\nIn the meantime, the Department of Defense is helping to conduct the testing and so, it can go after any of the whistleblowers without using a judicial requirement to, in effect, investigate them.\nA longtime Capitol Hill policeman, who believes in small things, writing a book, and not listening to others after he has gotten out of bed is also at the negotiation table.\nAnd the anxiety a member of Congress feels about his or her job doesn\'t end there.\nThe questions have already begun to surface.

362,"Coronavirus Package Would Bar Trump And Lawmakers From Funds, Top Democrat Says","['Updated April 2: You may recall on Monday that senators were mostly asking about the vaccine. They now include Sen. Larry Sabato, a Republican, and Rep. Jim Clyburn, a Democrat.\nBut the notion of floating an end-run around the administration with legislation that would effectively turn Trump and his allies into ""weakmen"" on foreign-policy issues is not entirely insane. And from the poll numbers in the latest Politico/Morning Consult survey, evidence is starting to show that any threat to national security from the vaccine has been low since Trump took office.\nAccording to the latest surveys from the nonpartisan Internet research firm Pew Research Center, Americans overwhelmingly oppose President Trump’s plans to ban federally-funded vaccines.\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said last week that Trump did have the authority to do so without Congress’s approval, according to CNN. That prompted Democrats to wonder if something Trump would have to happen to stop the health effects of banning vaccines in the first place. They wrote a letter to HHS Secretary Tom Price asking him to clarify that the Department of Health and Human Services is independent of HHS, and Democrats suggested their letter was over-the-top.\nPew Research is not the first to peg the public’s reaction to Trump’s vaccine policies as rooted in fears and fears. In an August survey by Fox News, more than half of adults said they disapprove of Trump’s prescriptions for combating the Zika virus and his record on immigration. And some pollsters there found that nearly a third of respondents in the survey were also very concerned about Trump’s health-care plan. In response, Trump came under fire at the World Economic Forum last month.\n\'The worst of all worlds\'\nIn a Vox interview earlier this year, Kellyanne Conway said the U.S. government had funded two studies urging Trump’s administration to be “the single largest proponent of funding the National Institutes of Health for infectious diseases,” according to the Washington Post.\nBut Conway’s quote, and Trump’s personal opinion, was ""not necessarily in line with what America needs."" It also was just before a Reuters report from last November on two studies suggesting that keeping vaccinations away from children could risk children being infected. Trump even publicly called out the effects of the vaccines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health in response to the Reuters report.\nConway was the one who came under fire from the internet press after invoking Trump’s statements to encourage him to go into ""self-defense mode.""\nBut actually there is no question that Trump and his aides know how dangerous a vaccine can be. While there are few facts on how vaccines work, there is no doubt that the plague of measles in the last decade has led millions of American parents to hide their vaccines and vaccinate them.\nThe answers are quite clear. Vaccines are the easiest, best, most effective and cheapest way to fight off the symptoms of measles. If you believe your child is under some kind of special dietary restriction, you will usually know that this issue needs to be addressed. This means beefing up American public health efforts around this important vaccine issue, including, for a start, boosting the number of schools that offer a choice over their own vaccination rates.\nBut there is also a lot to do about it. States that allow private-sector companies to take ownership of routine vaccinations know that the research process could and would be much more extensive than that originally envisioned. The most recent effort in Europe is to test and define a new type of vaccine for fighting measles in children, hoping to help cement people’s commitments to the right kind of vaccination. North Carolina started with a ban on all private-sector vaccines but also enacted a measure banning vaccination for people with HIV. Supporters estimate that among the 7,000 measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) cases diagnosed in the United States this year, 710 children have been vaccinated for the disease.\nReaching out to allies, Trump will only need to convince them, and Germany has already apparently become the latest European player to agree to no-compromise efforts.\nPeter Bernstein is executive director of the Center for American Progress.

363,Senate Coronavirus Bill Includes $400 Million To Protect Elections,"['PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The Senate has approved legislation that will help prevent a repeat of a deadly outbreak of the deadly measles that could spread to other states, according to the Senate Health and Human Services Committee.\nSens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., co-sponsored the House version of the ""Extended Coverage"" bill. Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., who was one of several Republicans to vote against it, said a related bill will be filed shortly on the Senate floor, one of the last before the 2020 midterm elections.\nWyden and Watson Coleman oppose the long-sought bill because it would not allow states to require vaccines. The bill would do away with the use of blanket requirements for vaccines. Wyden said the measure would take care of the long-stalled MMR vaccine.\nRepublicans say the sweeping bill — which also would give federal officials access to old records on outbreaks — would protect future outbreaks from faulty revelations. The bill proposes random testing of all vaccines to determine which vaccines do not fall under the federal mandate. In addition, it would require that hospitals keep records of outbreaks after individual outbreaks; it would eliminate a requirement that state agencies give patients individual control. It would also establish a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention database to make it easier for law enforcement and other agencies to track outbreaks that occurred because they were linked to imported diseases.\nA vote of 116-34 against the bill is required to set up a hearing this summer.\n___\nFollow Heidi Groller on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/heidicurtamerica\n']"
364,Senate Passes $2 Trillion Coronavirus Relief Package,"['Despite studies that show link between antibiotic use and the disease, fewer than 2 percent of people over age 65 have antibiotics or lab tests that test for the virus.\nThe National Institutes of Health on Tuesday took another step toward reducing antibiotics and preventing antibiotic resistance in antibiotic-resistant bacteria by ratcheting up government oversight of the nation’s aging multibillion-dollar drug industry.\n“The world is watching us with horror and fear,” said National Institutes of Health Acting Chief Kevin Sabet, chairman of the Senate panel that oversees AIDS testing. Sabet co-sponsored a House bill similar to the House bill that would increase oversight of key government sector stocks.\nThe drug industry dominates drugmakers’ profits, producing nearly $47 billion in sales in the last fiscal year. With access to unmet medical needs among fewer than two million Americans, drugmakers get 45 percent more than their small peers, and increasingly replace their most efficient drugs with products from free-floating manufacturers such as Roche and Novartis.\nThe sweeping $2 trillion legislation approved by the House on Tuesday would direct drugmakers to add antibiotic regulators, curb drug-testing practices, or provide additional funding. The Senate bill, which was introduced in October, was approved in February by a 92-34 vote.\n“The provision we have to that you get today is a great boost for us to have a pivotal vote today and to answer your question on the progress that we have made across the spectrum of our drug economy,” Sabet said during a panel discussion sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse in Washington.\nStudy Findings\nThe National Institute on Drug Abuse reported on Tuesday that drug-testing practices have led to worrisome drug shortages that have been blamed for addictions to at least 43,000 prescription drugs in the last fiscal year, partially stemming from plant inflammation caused by a mutation in the immune system.\n“We are not making a decline in drug use,” said Allan Chen, a scientist at the institute. “It is, however, a major cause for some of the challenges we have today.”\nThe report also cited the fact that more Americans die each year from drug-resistant infections than from other problems — including heart disease and cancer — and that progress in the fight against drug-resistant infections is slower than expected.\nBy 2020, there will be fewer than 1,000 patients infected with drug-resistant infections for every 100 people dying from them, according to a Dec. 1 American Society of Clinical Oncology study. By 2023, 2,000 patients would die from drug-resistant infections.\nMORE DRAGGING\nDespite a growing vaccination movement among Americans of all ages, it’s rare for everyone who gets an antibiotic to get a dose, Sabet said. The report says 36 percent of the people who come in for tests were referred to a lung specialist to “out-patient” treatment — essentially access to tests.\nTreatment can lead to regretment, but it’s important to stop the destructive cycles of antibiotics that can cause so many of these superbugs to wreak havoc, he said.\n“Drug-resistant infections are real public health threats,” Sabet said. “We need to protect them to stop them before they start to spread.”\nAmong the report’s findings:\nPneumonia in infectious public health have risen more than twofold since 2005 to more than 8,000 cases.\nInfluenza vaccines have weakened the immune system for most people, but it has been a terrible public health hazard for those infected with the disease.\nTighter drug regulation has saved lives by reducing transmission of infections to distant sources, and eliminating high doses of antiviral medicines that use hundreds of sick people to kill them and collect the mucus that keeps them alive.\nSpreading public awareness of the threat of antibiotic resistance and more rigorous drug-control measures have begun to halt the spread of the disease.\nBut there is a continuing need for drug-testing success, Sabet said. And the consumer pressure to install effective test methods to detect bacterial pathogens is increasing, he said.\n“Consumers, it’s important that we do this right,” he said. “If we don’t, when they look at us in the future, they will come here, we won’t be here.”\n']"

""No politician needs to run for public office at that point. My best advice to anyone I\'d had any experience with is, whatever the venue, to get out there and get out and vote.""\nWell, evidently Mike Valeska will do just that, and he\'s running against a candidate who told Valeska he doesn\'t like how Biden carried Maine.\nDan Thompson, Thompson\'s campaign manager, said the three are just contrasting views.\n""We\'re hopeful that, by raising a couple of questions that Mike is ready to answer,"" he said. ""We don\'t believe that he\'s ever fought against the president and we think that he will be ready for his next shot.""\nThompson said the senator plans to file his own paperwork soon, to prove the allegations.\n""The polls show that Democrats believe Biden is one of the loudest voices in America,"" he said. ""We\'ll be filing his paperwork to substantiate it when it comes out.""\nThe Democratic National Committee issued a statement calling the accusations, including Thompson\'s statement, ""pure speculation,"" and Wickersham\'s explanation as yet untraditional.\n""Chris did some political research and found out that his parents went to see him last August. He had family in Maine recently and he came home nearly empty handed,"" Wickersham said. ""So when we met with him on Friday, we went to his house again, and heard the story we already knew about.""\nMeanwhile, the challenger in a general election has dropped another bombshell: It\'s not confirmed that or even likely that anybody else will campaign on his behalf.\nValeska\'s announcement raises an awkward question.

366,"Amid Pandemic Crisis, U.S. Wages Broader Messaging War With China","['U.S. wages have come under increasing strain as more and more Americans have shifted and made shifting their households, which have divided Americans into longer working-age males and women who are now less willing to receive new benefits and stagnant wages.\n“U.S. wages go up and I put it on the backburner that people are being priced out of the labor market,” said John Delaney, head of the non-partisan Economic Policy Institute in Washington. “It’s a good thing, but it’s a bit more frustrating. We can’t just stay here forever.”\nThe worsening gulf between the rich and working class is taking a toll on a myriad of different ways in which human beings rely on the various labor markets and social contracts, Ms. Delaney says.\nIn a changing economic environment—and a hugely indebted nation—often those trying to adapt themselves to jobs, including in the middle class, are being forced to come to terms with the realities of life. They often find themselves under tight monetary conditions, insecure employment opportunities, and falling median wage rates, fueling growth fears and recession fears.\n“This is a growing global growth environment,” Ms. Delaney said. “It’s in the service and consumer-facing sectors, whereas last time it was every other industry. A lot of companies, not all of them, are accepting that the time has come to tighten, the budget has tightened.”\nThe cascade of wealth from the stock market to the stock market is spreading its causes and gorging on “the bloated debt” that European leaders are demanding. Meanwhile, according to a survey of the labor market conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research, over half of the 1.4 million people in the United States are unemployed. The unemployment rate is so low that many job seekers are stopped from applying for interviews. As of Jan. 1, employers now offer three to five months of unemployment compensation for every full-time job—and six months on average for workers in the U.S. starting out.\nThe outbreak of the ill effects of globalization, or “mass exodus,” is a catalyst that is likely to leave at least one factory cashier shortage. While he or she simply couldn’t get out of bed from the cold, retailers could lose a lot of money at the end of the day when the lower value of the dollar, compounded with unpredictable weather, will do business.\n“When consumers do go out to buy, we’re burdened with some large purchases,” Mr. Delaney said. “The supply of customer service isn’t going to be really optimized, so it’s their ability to pick up the phone and fill out the forms that’s going to drive demand, so it’s going to have to be used.”\nOvercoming the grim challenges Americans facing, consumers are adopting more environmental preferences that can help them make the most of their less-than-stellar finances. As baby boomers reach the age of retirement, they need to embrace that, too. While about 34 percent of Americans expect to spend at least $1,000 a year before retirement, that’s predicted to be the lowest level since the mid-1970s, according to a 2013 survey by the Yale Institute of Fiscal Studies and the Economic Policy Institute. And only about 12 percent of households planning to retire with a nest egg of more than $200,000 own more than $2,000 per year.\n“In terms of fulfilling that investment, consumers just like merchants, shoppers, people with important relationships with them,” Ms. Delaney said. “They often have less control of their wallet.”\nThose disposable income is quickly coming to a head.

And officials are hoping his engagement in Helsinki, Finland, this weekend will begin to ratchet up tensions to the zero level.\nThis poses a major challenge to Trump\'s plan for the summit, one that would normally require him to take North Korea off the table.\n""I think the U.S. government is quite ready to move forward with that, because we are not the first government to do so,"" Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell told reporters Monday, according to CBS News. ""We\'ve been preparing in terms of summit proposals with the North Koreans. We\'ve been talking about the route.""\nHe reiterated that the request for the summit was ""not publicly made,"" CBS added.\nTrump and Kim discussed joint actions in recent months to advance nuclear disarmament, despite a series of trade sanctions and threats of a U.S. war against the regime in Pyongyang.\nA recent report by the Wall Street Journal, citing senior American officials, said that there might be greater pressure on the North Korean regime after Trump wrote a final letter to Kim in the summer of 2016 without publicly hinting that North Korea would leave the table.\nThe attempt to stop the current slide in relations is starting to get real for Trump and his administration.\nFrom Trump\'s breaking silence on the Syrian refugee crisis to his preparedness to travel to a joint UN town for another summit, the ""uncertainties surrounding the outcome of the G20 meetings are no secret,"" according to the Times of London.\nAfter watching the draft G20 reports on Thursday and ""increasingly wary"" about a last-minute deal in an effort to clear the way for an upcoming summit, Morrell said he has a ""very positive"" outlook.\n""What we\'re focused on, absolutely, is containing North Korea because as we\'ve said before, it\'s going to hurt us,"" he said.

As any military tool can tell you, it\'s there to guide a member in the right direction — because in a way, that\'s what miscalculations actually prove. That\'s true in this case, yes, even whether that\'s a wise mind, right? We\'ve all discussed it in the past, but the prevailing fear is that we\'re sending a message to our leaders, either by passing controversial portions of the General Services Administration (GSA) Act (known as the Fiscal Responsibility Act) or by giving an in-house lobbyist access to GSA\'s General Services Department (GSA) functions.\nThe relevant concepts in this case — namely:\nCreate an open and transparent operation of the GSA in order to address both traditional strategic concern/revisionary mandates and new competitive pressures.\nClose control and oversight mechanisms. This will provide greater transparency by allowing GSA\'s leaders and elected officials to view strategic problems, as well as to get a better understanding of the workings of GSA.\nReplace the thinking and philosophy of an overly detailed legal procedure.\nFinally, reset governance activities to ensure proper oversight by partnering with a regular legislative body, as required by U.S. law.\nIn the end, GSA will most likely be more accountable to its constituents, but that didn\'t bother Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA), who herself is working with both the GSA and GSDA. Thus, we might never see the government preserve any semblance of accountability, by assigning it to one entity, like the Justice Department or National Security Agency. In fact, that\'s exactly what\'s likely.\nAs for the reconciliation process, although it\'s in its infancy, much could be done to ensure these changes are fiscally responsible.\n']"

Vanuatu President Walter Davis said. ""We decreased oil and gas from the [Fermentation] Ltd.""\nOther island nations, which currently maintain efficient water systems, expanded water resources, and introduced water quality management, might as well have easily recertified their countries to look forward to the promise of co-operation with Vanuatu.\nOne of Vanuatu\'s parties on the report, Australian International Maritime Organization (AMAO), worked with Fiji to develop a co-environmental study with the help of many countries on the coast, which studied a grant application for the Maluso Maluso-Maluso coastal water treatment project, which draws on data generated by the Maluso Maluso-Tadetie seawater treatment plant.\nYet before any of that move was undertaken, the United Nations\'s International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) came to view the islands\' very existence as a silver lining.\n""We were not really sure that the islands were so depleted,"" says Tam Wong, a former United Nations climate envoy who headed the team that led the environmental assessment study.\nThey could hardly have been counting on things to improve if their world was just one inexorable shift away from causing catastrophic climate change, so they designed to work with other countries, making the process less laborious.\n""They told us that before we could get people to see the past, they needed us to see the present,"" Wong explains. ""But I was surprised. When we were provided the very first example of people doing work, it was a good response.""\nOthers, sensing an opportunity, also worked with Vanuatu to expand the mechanization process to improve soil fertility, making clean water easier to drink, and make land more conducive to biodiversity. That\'s what this study did.\nBut as Malcolm Boyd, recently acknowledged as an expert in International Waters Integrity, a progressive Institute for Policy Studies think tank, warned:\n""These projects are facing distinct challenges. Overall the study paints a picture of grave inequity, with the Maluso Maluso project becoming par for the course, leading to exponential reductions in biodiversity.""\nIt is one thing to study the plight of coral reefs, when the reality is extreme heat spells, but the vast resources and technical infrastructure required to catch fish have led to hundreds of documented loss of habitat and an unprecedented rise in ocean acidification. Even if the Pacific Island nations can alleviate the areas\' environmental problems, they can\'t help themselves.\n']"

Rabin, for instance, came in March of this year when the country allowed for its simultaneous absorption of Jews out of a historically historically occupied neighborhood known as “Nablus.”\nThe move dramatically altered the demographic context and served as a nail in the coffin for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition, which on March 31 confirmed the hand of Premier Menachem Begin, a nationalist movement leading in the West Bank since 1967.\nNow the “The Real Israel” and the political storyline, as Netanyahu describes it, has re-ignited in Israel.\nThe decade long Israeli government, announced in a media blitz in April, has drawn criticism in some quarters, including the Jewish Press, for raking off a new opportunity to punish Israel for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s (Turkish) bid to control the second city of Jerusalem, the archipelago that is the Jewish state’s capital.\nThe author, Steve Doron at the Jerusalem Post, says they’ve made it a two-pronged attack. He says the public reaction has been muted, and that Netanyahu is throwing in the towel in a way that Israelis dread. He’s not the least bit bothered by the comparison.\nBut unlike the scene in the western city of Beersheba and the neighboring towns of Beersheba, the situation in Jerusalem is completely different. No polls have indicated an uptick in support for Prime Minister Netanyahu.\nThe 2014 polls showed that President Netanyahu had supported far less than the previous government, in large part because of a negative opinion of his handling of Israel’s domestic political environment, including his hostile relations with the Palestinians. His ratings rose at the most recent polls, and his poll numbers were revised upward to nine percent in January.\nOrignally published by Nati Hirsch\nRead more posts on Nati Hirsch »\nRead the original article on Nati Hirsch.

383,Kosovo Is In Turmoil After Coronavirus Controversy Helped Fell Its Government,"['When the once prosperous country of Kosovo will decide whether to become a nation, we will have to figure out the politics around the process. Security-related issues may seem to have slowed Kosovo’s progress, but if this country was to achieve any significant political stability, it will have to catch up to South American and African countries that have far-reaching issues like climate change, the breakup of former Yugoslavia, and the 2018 US election.\nPoroshenko has steadily restructured the country since he became president in 2009. After two decades of oppression, soldiers and police, and heavy voter-suppression campaigns, the entire country began to fall apart in 2003. The Kosovo government faced all-out civil war that the majority of people deemed peaceful — something that was hard to find even among the Serbs.\nBy 2014, Kosovo finally took control of its sovereignty. This move helped in several ways. For example, Kosovo made it clear it would fight all of the United States’ proposed carbon sequestration plans, while providing greater democracy to the new majority. This prompted some to question whether the West was really a good ally for the former Yugoslav nation, or was a small country struggling with its own ethnic problems.\nTo demonstrate just how much impact the movement has had, according to some recent studies, Kosovo’s second largest regional Kurdish group, the Kurdistan Democratic Party, had jumped into the global spotlight. Like the other Kurdish militia, the PKK had faced violence from the Kosovo government and various leftist movements. The PKK then emerged as a credible political force in Kosovo, claiming that it was wholly owned by the country’s Muslim communities.\nKosovo’s secession from Serbia in 1999 left many of its neighbors to list Kosovo’s neighbors as a “terrorist province” which Kosovo was allowed to settle with stable, but difficult, results. The government of the country’s new prime minister, Gilgit Baltazar, held numerous informal meetings with the Kurds, which ultimately led to what will be a highly contested referendum on the question of Kosovo’s future.\nDespite the looming uncertainty, the Kosovo government has remained strong. Last year, at a summit organized by the Kosovo Red Cross and Hashd al-Shura, a large number of ethnic Albanians demonstrated support for the newly empowered government, who also had the support of the British government.\nBelgium, France, and the United States all engaged in consultations with Belgrade in the wake of the incident. The EU Economic Community hosted the conference in Brussels, where it was invited to become the EU-NATO coordinating country for the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Kosovo (MINUSTAH). Kosovo has also been hosting an eight-day peace talks by which it hopes to avoid Western sanctions and an eventual partition of the country.\nWhat was unexpected about the meeting was the sense of solidarity in Kosovo. For some Balkan analysts, this was a signal of victory, and also a reminder that the various political groups who support the ethnically separate Kosovo government—most notably the Kurdish, Orthodox, and Assyrian church-enablers in Belgrade—had been at least somewhat marginalized during the early years of Kosovo’s statehood.\nHowever, Malicious Dark Clouds have begun to scare potential EU diplomats. Only weeks ago, however, the British Foreign Office announced that it is actively backing away from Kosovo to avoid political embarrassment.\nFor those unable to travel to Kosovo for the foreseeable future, the country’s four major cities could be without any of the most important energy resources. Therefore, the EU’s decision to be a member of the European Union could make a huge difference to the future of Kosovo, which has a huge energy crisis. For years, Kosovo’s hydro-electric dams, almost fully functioning, have depended on the EU’s resources.\nFortunately, the very time the EU and NATO gets to study and debate this matter is at an end. A negotiated conclusion is possible, even if political frustration appears to be rising against it. With a clear “no” to its potential, Kosovo’s government is not left unable to govern. That hope should keep many from leaving Kosovo.\nJoplin Blair is a senior fellow at Inter-American Dialogue.

384,"Iran Needs Help To Fight Coronavirus, But Delivering Aid Is A Challenge","['Geneva, April 1 (IANS) Are we increasingly concerned about the spread of the common cancer that the World Health Organization says is spreading in Iran? Are there more than 22 cases of Coronavirus spread every day in the country? Why do so many more cases remain silent?\nThe epidemic was started by the same virus that spread through glass flu viruses in the 1950s. It spread rapidly throughout Iran from 1925 to the 1960s. The virus has been spreading beyond the outside world and in the region.\nBut, they don’t know how it ended. Globally the disease spread fast, even though many governments had to shut down hospitals in the country until 2005 and change the way Iran’s medical infrastructure was monitored and managed. The country had contracted 150 quarantines.\nSo the WHO has called for International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) to upgrade the preventive activity of clinical treatment to the treatment of life-threatening diseases. But the World Health Organization’s assurance that “both the elimination of the disease (one dose per day), and a protection against the virus from all treatment (using only one dose per day) must remain, irrespective of the country’s own drug portfolios” is extremely limited.\nUnfortunately, Iran has been criticised for this lack of clean/methodical treatment for its people by civil society and a number of doctors’ groups and universities.\nIARC said that half the patients admitted to hospital died or died soon after the first admission. Each patient died for two days. Overall, 1,075 patients died within a short period of time from the disease.\nIn Iran, many health organizations say that the virus is spread through saliva. According to the World Health Organization, almost 10 per cent of all cases in the world are people.\nWhile there is no evidence that the virus spreads through saliva, every hospital in Iran reported a similar number of cases.\nDrugs that hold up the symptom-free manner for some people can be harmful. The Global Alliance Against Lurinary Infections (GALAI) was recently presented by scientists at Saudi Arabia’s National Iranian Medical University and other institutes.\nThe National Iranian Medical Council (NIMB) warned that the risk of acute kidney disease (AKE) had increased as new infections could worsen their severity.\n“Tragic cases of AKE seem to be the new variant of the virus, whereas other viruses are yet to show symptoms of this new variant,” and the International AKE Society warned that while the virus can be spread more easily in Iran, it’s also spread more easily among Iranian and international health institutions.\nContacting the President of Saudi Arabia, Dr. Ras al-Sayed praised Dr. Hassan Bazdar for the organization’s efforts in implementing the policy of joint inspection of C02 labs in Iran and all other countries.\n“These institutions have taken up the task of sharing symptoms of AKE, allowing them to transmit the virus to the health system which is already infected by the disease,” said Dr. Hassan Bazdar.\nIn China, only two cases of the disease have been reported in 2016, the worst year for avian influenza in half a century. In the first quarter of the year, a million people were sickened, with the worst air quality being measured in Beijing during the third quarter.\nIn Peru, Coronavirus was detected in a European company that has been required to make a two-year commercial return on its investments. The virus stopped all its transmission in the European country until it can be tested in Peru and it will eventually be made available.\n']"
385,"'We Are At War,' WHO Head Says, Warning Millions Could Die From COVID-19","[""For the second time in a week, a new report has released showing that rising rates of human mortality from natural causes can cause significant economic damage.\nLet's take a closer look at what scientists have been saying.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is making the first study of COVID-19, an automatic feature that protects astronauts from asteroids and comets. It's supposed to provide a barrier to space impacts, since it's still vulnerable to increased temperatures and other stresses during that activity.\nAccording to the report, the reactivation of these automatic features brings about a deterioration of the part of the atmosphere that may act as a barrier to asteroid impacts and future tsunamis:\nResearchers predict that we will be at war with another rock-popping geological cycle as events such as ice caps and sea level rise push more low-lying regions, such as the Arctic, into the ocean, creating landslides and acidification, all while reducing the threat of catastrophic tsunamis.\n… These new findings, published in the prestigious American Geophysical Union’s journal, Geophysical Research Letters, show that COVID-19 can alter the way earthquakes and tsunamis take place. By occurring within a protected area, the robots and robot arms can detect both asteroids and comets and compress them into less than a cubic-foot size to give their cryosleeps the lift and space to rise. This is expected to decrease the likelihood of an immediate impact, which is one of the most powerful consequences a natural disaster can have. COVID-19 could also increase the risk of tsunamis, thus promoting global warming.\nAdditionally, in line with the article, the report, says COVID-19 increased global temperature by 2 degree Celsius.\nThe study's authors say that COVID-19 could play a critical role in the future of the fossil fuel industry as surface temperatures rise due to the presence of warmer winter weather.\n“We estimate that COVID-19 can cause an additional 200,000 deaths per year. This may very well be premeditated,” said Dr. Jean-Paul Roward, a partner at the University of Missouri Mo. “We predict there will be a strong real-world impact from atmospheric COVID-19 even after severe caps on the seas that are still falling.”\nThe authors also noted that COVID-19 also plays a critical role in the formation of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\nCurrent scientific studies have shown that COVID-19 likely played a crucial role in Hurricanes Katrina and Hurricane Rita during the 1990s. Although researchers didn't know whether they were involved in any significant impacts on the natural environment, it's safe to say that powerful COVID-19 could play a major role in the future of the land and water supply.\nSOURCE: NOAA\n""]"
386,U.S. Forces In Syria Tackle A More Complex — And Possibly Dangerous — Mission,"['WASHINGTON— President Donald Trump has vowed to rebuild the United States’ military capability in the country he governs and his administration has promised to ban Russian aircraft in U.S. air space.\nBut when it comes to not bombing Muslim terrorist groups, Trump is not the first to agree, almost exactly 10 years after becoming president, that the Trump administration is not willing to follow through on those promises. On Monday, Secretary of Defense James Mattis reaffirmed his disapproval of an arrangement with Russia that allowed the United States to hold an Islamic State fighter-bomber convoy on the Syrian border without the United States receiving permission.\nThe objections of the Republican president are not a surprise given that he has tweeted repeatedly about the failure of the Obama administration to achieve a settlement to the Syrian civil war and that he had requested an assessment of the situation in Syria. While he is said to have collected enough evidence of terrorist attacks against civilians in the country to warrant the demands of the president, it is known that the U.S. has a warily researched counterweight to Russia in Syria and that this is the responsibility of the Syrian government.\nTrump’s candid language in favor of the United States’ political allies at war is a breathtaking game of cat and mouse. “Russia, the world is watching. With your guns outstretched, we will strike you hard.” The brief as Trump boasts about softening America’s hostile position reflects President Trump’s indifference to Russian aggression, instead of the criticisms of U.S. allies. The president’s attitude and the consequences thereof are disturbing, and it serves as an “undisputed” signal of abandonment of our defense in the world.\nAt the same time, no administration in public history has halted a “effective” offensive or reduced the U.S. military to size.\nPrior to his campaign, President Trump remarked that he “would fire our, many, many, many missiles.” “For weapons of mass destruction to be known in any number of languages as successful,” he said in August 2001. That was no longer the case. During the height of his campaign, Trump boasted of banning the use of Russian-made warplanes, citing the United States’ right to act against Islamic State.\nThe erstwhile vice-president and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Admiral James McCrary, cautioned against the president’s earlier assertion that he has lost “knowledge and confidence in the capability of a sophisticated air-bomber campaign to eradicate” U.S. forces.\nMcComb reasserted his argument that his country had “lost its understanding of mission.” He emphasized that “the enemy knows what his mission is.” He suggested that in order to find it, the U.S. has to have “the high-tech air-bomber capability that’s necessary to prevent the next,” in his words.\nWhile taking the issue of Iran’s continued destabilizing influence in Syria as an obvious point to resolve, Trump apparently recognizes the formidable challenge of counteracting Russia’s double-sided military offensive in Syria. Indeed, all but a few of his top advisers have echoed Trump’s longstanding defense of the Obama administration’s 2015 bargain to buy an estimated 20,000 American Humvees from the Russian Defense Ministry and to train Syrian soldiers in a battle against Islamic State. Indeed, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reportedly told reporters earlier this week that there was “no air-bomber capability” in Syria.\nAnd, despite frequent Russian denials to the contrary, Western allies must admit that it is hard to imagine that Trump or his administration have the capability to remove the Iranian threat from Syrian skies in a matter of months. He has done so in several instances, from instituting an immigration regime to reconstituting our anti-terrorist ring and arms-share with Russia that would, in turn, eliminate Russian expansion into the Syrian civil war. If you look closely, you will see that even with this staunchly pro-American posture, the Western alliance is almost too weak for even the slightest of general effect to help Russia eliminate U.S. capabilities.\nMcCall has made clear that Trump, as long as he has the American military standing behind him, will be the beneficiary of the next crises. Such is the prospect of Trump when he takes the reins of national security in the White House.\n• Department of Defense intelligence director Robert Dole supports the deployment of U.S. armed forces as they are needed to protect American interests, its countries, its citizens and the United States itself.\nFollow Pentagon correspondent Kenneth Hahn on Twitter and Facebook.\n']"

388,How South Korea Reined In The Outbreak Without Shutting Everything Down,"['South Korea’s isolated new outbreak of hepatitis C after a food poisoning outbreak caused by consumed pork was made more likely by an injection of a live horse skin-like virus. Here’s how to prevent the spread of the deadly virus in a rapid and efficient way.\nEntertainer Dr. Suk Sang-ki, who recently told Radio Free Asia that hepatitis C is the biggest pandemic since the 1918 influenza pandemic, and that ridding the world of its old food stock is key to ending the outbreak.\n“With the recent outbreak of hepatitis C, the question has been posed: can people get infections without the help of mouth-to-mouth,” said Dr. Suk. “For the average person, AHHD cannot spread through eating, drinking, eating, drinking, alcohol, smoking and tobacco, and hepatitis C requires quick treatment, sustained pressure, and emotional support with the help of a life-saving clinical therapy.”\nThe West had been worried about eating hog waste, but that has now been resolved, with the Government announcing that drinking hot dogs will be banned from the streets.\n“People will no longer be allowed to drink hot dogs, pork snacks, and porkies. There will be no additional restrictions or limits of diet,” Food & Drug Administration officials said.\nOn the other hand, it’s not enough to ban human consumption of cattle from livestock. Since humans are more sensitive to food poisoning than cattle, most countries have banned meat from cattle from slaughter to the slaughterhouses.\nThe big concern here is not the government, but how the food stock is distributed. This was something many governments had long hoped for, and it’s a big priority for the Government. The fear is the never-ending battle for the control of the infected herd has kept some farmers up at night. It’s also a huge concern for the government.\nSo South Korea took a dose of the Hepatitis C virus to produce a formula for the same medicine used to treat cancer, but it won’t be enough. Even so, many South Koreans don’t want to return to the gutter.\nMost adults, though, don’t mind buying hot dogs, drinks, drinking, and other special foods before taking the virus home. So far this outbreak has not had a significant effect on eating habits. As Professor Kim Dong-jin, who teaches at the Royal Institute of Dental and Cardiology in Seoul, states, health professionals will keep everyone safe from hepatitis C, so be careful with the words “obese.”\n“People who do inject drug have reported always being more likely to become infected with the disease, although most people do not develop hepatitis C. There is also no proof yet that there are treatments available, but you have to be mindful of reducing your risk of passing the virus on to others,” said Professor Kim.\nTo reduce the effects of the Hepatitis C pandemic, South Korea is now looking at ways to package the food. Producers are moving away from table grapes and grapes from nearby vegetable farms, and beef from beef-producing “dolls” are moving to a table farm in the port city of Gangnam. South Korea wants to ask the state to review how the meat is prepared, and work with voluntary manufacturers to ensure that it’s packaged to ensure people are protected.\nMedical director of the Sonjit Hospital, Vinje Joong-koo, told Weng Tae-yong, “Developing a vaccination program for Hepatitis C is not just about food sales, it’s about preventing the spread of Hepatitis C, so it is important that you take care of your food well before it hits you.”\nDr. Seong Lee Gee, director of the Asia Pacific Hepatitis Research Program at the Shanghai Institute of Health Medicine, told Weng Tae-yong that the vaccine would not be enough to prevent the spread of the virus.\n“The vaccine will help humans prevent the virus even if it causes harm in others,” Dr. Seong said. “Chances are most people would have died from influenza simply with their viral loads diminished by humans.”\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

389,"Still Locked in Conflict, Israelis and Palestinians Need Each Other To Fight COVID-19","['Sixty-seven years after United Nations Security Council Resolution 181 was adopted on Jan. 1, 1948, and 149 years after the declaration of independence by Israel from the state of Palestine, tensions are rising between the people of Gaza and Israel. Yesterday, while hundreds of thousands of people were marching along the Temple Mount, Israel’s Defense Minister, Herut Ya’alon, declared that the 1967 borders of Israel have been frozen, or have become “settlements.”\nThis speech not only strikes many of those who attended this march with a different agenda from the intifada; it also reaffirms the fundamental point that Israel is not meant to be a good neighbor to its neighbors, but to build its entire state on the basis of mutual respect and understanding.\nHumanitarian conditions stand in the way of an intensification of civil warfare. Israel is wielding every tool at its disposal to eradicate its citizens from their lives and lives of way. To achieve peace, Israel’s current state-sponsored terrorism cannot be allowed to succeed. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is not yet confined to military or humanitarian operations; it can be drawn into political and social contradictions. For instance, Gaza has forced civilians from their homes and pushed them to the edge of the flames of Israeli-hostile ground and air attacks.\nThe UN Security Council Resolution 181 calls for the “complete withdrawal” of Israel from Gaza, but precisely this goal is a trap: do Israeli weapons adequately protect it, and the population of Gaza demands that the IDF abide by the terms of the 1974 Israeli Mandate.\nIsrael’s latest six-point plan, adopted yesterday, calls for the establishment of a permanent disengagement from Gaza and a phased easing of restrictions on movement in and out of it. That leaves Israel trying to manage Hamas in the Gaza Strip, and encourage its Islamist movement to cease rocket attacks in Israel.\nThe UN resolution explicitly gives Israel the right to control the Strip. However, it does not authorize its creation in Gaza. Israel would need the strong support of the Security Council to prove to the United Nations that it intends to pursue a unilateralist policy, and to avert war with Hamas.\nIsrael has the option of freezing Gaza, launching a retaliatory action, or launching a massive military offensive in an attempt to drive Hamas into submission. Even if Israel were to achieve a miracle in stopping Hamas in Gaza, it wouldn’t be successful, and that would be a catastrophe. That is why the Comprehensive Coalition Force for Reconstruction of Gaza (CFRER) has declared war against Hamas.\nA new column in The Wall Street Journal this week reported that Israel would now seriously consider using force against a Hamas force controlling Gaza. That maneuver fits into the narrative of using military force to prevent the outbreak of civil war, and is likely to lead to an escalation of the conflict.\nIsrael has made numerous attempts to erode its resolve with the U.N. Security Council and with the world. But that diplomacy and its consequences are still deeply embedded in the interests of Israel and Hamas. For Israelis to find the “golden bridge” – while those of Hamas remain predominantly supported by Hamas – to support Israel’s policy of control over Gaza is a step in the wrong direction.\nThe nationalist Malala Yousafzai, a Yemeni student leader who shot down an Israeli drone during an unsuccessful campaign to take back her school from Islamic militants, has expressed hope that U.N. voices will finally show their support for Israel’s policy. But today, the attention of U.N. ambassadors seems to be at just one of those too focused on expanding the story of occupation.\nMost Israelis see the problems inherent in the complicated “separation” of Israeli-Palestinian conflict that more than half of Israelis attend. To the contrary, the majority of Israelis see both positive and negative consequences of the seemingly inviolable borders on the one hand and their steadily rising need for security on the other.\nRabbi Ya’alon said that “those who believe that for an imagined uprising – both the Egyptian-Israeli struggle and the Palestinian-Israeli struggle – one body is for justice and peace only are wrong and want to exploit the division between those who believe in peace and those who believe in Israel’s law and its values.”\nRead more by Rachel Siegel\n']"

393,India's Doctors Worry The Country Is Unprepared For A Coronavirus Surge,"['A few months ago a WHO study showed that people with stomach flu don\'t have the resources to travel to the nearest hospital. Now, patients are getting bitten, and some emergency departments are overwhelmed with requests.\nIn India, this year has proved too cold, snowy and humid, and the country\'s doctors are concerned about the possibility of a surge in a patient population. India is also trying to manage the shortage of antibiotics and vaccines from infections like swine flu.\nBut a major long-term study evaluating the risks of increased infections with gastroenteritis into Indian hospitals has highlighted that steps can be taken to stop as much of the problem from spreading to more hospitals around the country.\nFirst, a study found that people in India who come to visit a hospital for gastroenteritis are more likely to be infected after taking part in a random physical exam.\nThe study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, found that half of gastroenteritis patients who have been at a hospital for long stretches are exposed to more infection than the percentage that aren\'t at a hospital.\nResearchers say the change in pace in China\'s much-maligned health system tends to reduce attempts at infection prevention. ""A study called the Genex Morinovirus Study is the latest example of a trend to shrink healthcare systems, undermining efforts to reduce an increase in antibiotic-resistant infections,"" the study found.\nWhen are people treated for gastroenteritis in India?\nEven if you\'re one of the patients in one of the 36 hospitals which cover gastroenteritis, you might be infected. Surgically, there is a vast lack of treatment, and even when the virus is most prevalent in those countries, it\'s possible that it takes several months for it to reach the top of the list of infection. That might make it a little more difficult for when it\'s time to treat an infection.\nAbout 5% of infections in India are deadly and most of those infections can be caught within two weeks.\nRegardless of the reason why a case is an infection, it\'s important to know that there are treatment options, including medications, antibiotics, diagnostic tests, and diagnostic tests.\nPutting a mouse to bed is also important, as they need treatment if the infection is left untreated. A root cause is the lack of electrical juice or energy storage in the mouse that produces the drug called poo.\nThe reason is that it creates an imbalance in which the solution is unable to get through. When the rheumatoid arthritis system stops working, this affects the melon supply. When the poo is dissolved in urine or absorbed, the steroids are used to relieve symptoms.\nIntolerance of an infection can be decreased, as the toxin has the effect of killing bacteria so, for example, a pregnant woman who has been to visit a hospital doesn\'t develop any problems after taking medication may have a harder time dealing with the infection.\nResearchers say these efforts to control the overcrowding in Indian hospitals and reduce the rate of infections are working.\nThe group said it is hoping to raise money to further their work in a way that also provides for change to help treat healthcare providers in the country.\n""We believe that it is important that as India\'s population of over 1 billion people grows over the next few decades, we can give our healthcare providers a better voice in their decision-making processes, and thus support the implementation of policies to develop a more public sector capacity to address these problems,"" the study said.\nIt went on to say that there needs to be a way for countries to “hustle” the way they are dealing with their healthcare crises and increase the impact of innovations that they employ to reduce the problem.\nMore to come, from the report:\n']"

In my exclusive interview with Daniela Garotico, the executive director of Transform, she explains what is really behind the arguments between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.\nYou might be hearing a lot of Trump during the campaign. Right now, the Americans seem not to have quite what they used to have. You’d find everyone you know expressing outrage at the election.\nBut what? You’d have to have your doubts, which is one thing, Garotico says. While it’s been said before and we’re crying at similar issues. Let’s not overreact! However, we have a problem when those we depend on need to comment on Trump-related issues. It’s what makes us count on “truth-telling.” That we use to be seen as furthering our political and social rights is what has made us distinct from our peers.\nGiven the current timing of major elections, what’s the best way for you to reassure yourself that you’re still under pressure to vote?\nIf there’s such a thing as a phony election, it’s a referendum on issues. Believe it or not, the election system makes so much sense when, for example, it’s the party that purports to represent and elect the people. We’re a part of a non-partisan party. Our opinion matters. If you don’t agree with us, then it really does not matter what you voted for.\nWe’re talking about electing, for example, the greatest president of our nation. At the end of the day, we’ve got to decide whether that’s the right thing to do and who we want to elect.\nWhen it comes to honesty and integrity, you can change the outcome of a campaign completely. That’s why the election is called right now. Of course, there’s many people who don’t know our system but who just want the perfect election to result in a leader of their choice. But remember, the only poll that will even know what a big difference we made this election had to Hillary. There’s so much we can do to change our society, and this system is broken. Nobody should worry about real outcomes. If they don’t know us, then the next election is going to be ours.\nFollow The Week on Twitter and Instagram.\n']"

We\'ve seen their dollars go, both by state and federal government. The burden goes to New York State.\n""These people who are managing this fellas, are advised to a 21st century time capsule,"" Cuomo continued. ""Never forget this last month, the governor visited more than 2,000 municipalities throughout the state to speak with a number of people about New York, because it was the first time in his life he did what I would have done 25 years ago, Gov. Cuomo, was there. I call on every executive of government to follow that example as New York continues to rebound, the city is a shell of its former self and now in the midst of its worst crisis of my generation. It\'s time to have a dialogue about exactly that.""\nCuomo also criticized Trump administration policies toward immigrants:\nIn saying what he said at the start of this morning\'s speech, Governor Cuomo said, ""If you lose track of your own time, you lose a great, great state and you lose important citizens, and I would much rather see everybody relax and enjoy the Maine vacation and yet another Great State on a weekend in Connecticut.""\nNew York mayor Bill de Blasio refused to explain the comparison to Trump, but he defended his city and state:\nFirst and foremost, I want to clear the air.

Naughton\nThe death toll from the growing virus that has made possible the rapid spread of the disease in the United States has surpassed 2,000 — a staggering 7,723 of them in New York City alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nCDC officials said the number of deaths attributed to the bug is less than 3 percent of the total number of cases worldwide in 2015. The death toll from severe flu also has surpassed 3,000.\nNaughton said the number is simply unexpected, though no one knows what has made this so dire a month for flu epidemics. Experts said the CDC still has few options for extending some restrictions, such as a ban on visitors visiting New York City at Halloween.\nThe CDC reported this week that the virus is spreading in three major southern American counties and spreading rapidly across the nation and Canada.\nPediatricians across the country said despite serious illness and deaths, public health officers are even more focused on stopping the spread of the virus through proper precautions and information efforts.\nAdditional documents also have been issued by the CDC advising people to keep eye and respiratory exams up to date, follow up with them if symptoms arise, and check the emergency room if an individual is declared fully infected.\nAfter testing negative for the virus in a previous phase of a phase that included more patients experiencing symptoms, the CDC’s only case reported so far is in the Central North Branch of New York City.\n“This virus is rapidly spreading from the northern part of the country to the south because of the unique patient characteristics such as type 2 diabetes, high fever, diabetes and neutropenia, as well as the historical origins of this disease,” the CDC wrote in its update.\nU.S. health officials are appealing to the public to avoid traveling this Halloween, which is also considered flu season. People traveling in the Northeast, West Coast and in Canada are also warned to watch for severe flu symptoms.\nA flu outbreak in southern New York City is also being watched for signs that are apparent during the cold snap ahead of spring.\nFlu flu peaks in October and February, among the busiest times for flu activity in the U.S.\nThe deadliest strain of the virus so far has already been deemed safe. But the CDC has declared a swine flu pandemic in the United States. The virus is not spreading rapidly from Mexico to Canada, but has been linked to isolated cases in Caribbean countries and is in widespread use.\nNo cases have been reported since last August, the first time the deadly outbreak was linked to Canada.\nAdditional officials caution that vigilance should be taken in alerting citizens to one another to avoid the risk of illness because it does not produce any symptoms.\nThe spread of the virus can be especially dangerous for infants, who are especially at risk from direct exposure to the viral virus because their brains can rapidly develop and incubate the virus for up to 48 hours.\n“We are working to prevent a potentially devastating neuroinflammatory invasion or inflammation of the brain such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy. This potentially neurotoxic to newborns and their ability to delay a progressive brain injury,” the CDC said.\nU.S. children who are diagnosed with the flu are more likely to develop an injury to the head or extremities and could contract a deadly brain disease, the CDC warned.\n“The actual link between birth defects, low IQ, loss of neurological function and brain injury was never disclosed and was never reported,” the CDC warned.\nOther flu symptoms can include high fever, feeling very wet and a heavy snow habit.\nSymptoms of the flu include vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, body aches and pains in the mouth and hands, according to the CDC.\nLusts of the virus can emerge into the body and spread to the brain. The bug can also carry pollen from pollen can increase the risk of severe respiratory illness.\n“It is extremely important for pregnant women to visit their doctor whenever they are feverish and a woman to follow up with her doctor if symptoms develop,” a CDC statement said.\nThe influenza virus is not very common in the United States, but can be deadly, particularly if developed early.\nThe CDC has issued a briefing paper, public health tips and advice for concerned Americans.\n“A rash of influenza can trigger severe illness if not controlled,” the CDC said.\nThe CDC says that flu symptoms are “more serious than those in years past” because flu is “experiencing these symptoms for several days.” Symptoms can develop slowly after a few days.\nMore information on flu can be found at the CDC website.\n“Pneumonia is one of the most contagious complications of influenza, so it�']"

For Biden, 66 percent of those voters said they would back Mattis; Trump opposed him at 41 percent.\nWhite House officials disputed the results, saying they’re a “small sample” of the voting public.\nA year ago, Trump turned out 54 percent of voters who said they backed his “massive open borders policy and foreign policy,"" according to an April 2016 Quinnipiac University poll. Just 29 percent who supported that policy backed him.\nTrump hasn’t said why he wants to replace his four-year term at the White House, suggesting he has made his decision before or after the midterms. He insists he wants to avoid any distraction by taking the holidays and looking ahead.\nAs part of his effort to assemble a Cabinet of experienced aides, Trump has held private conversations with cabinet members over the past week and a half.

400,The Great American Migration of 2020: On the move to escape the coronavirus,"['International beaches, roads, and bridges that opened on the cheap are things of many preoccupations for Americans, though less so for the immigrants of the past century who came to address them. This is true for immigrants, too, but mostly for immigrants who, once there were local customs to feel, had no status to uphold and do well.\nWe know of tens of thousands of them, most of them from immigrants living in Mexico, who settled in cities and towns across the Midwest. Their homes and schools provide great examples of their presence. They were cultural, political, and, according to folklore, children of immigrants who preferred to simply live in poverty. When their children were born, they also grew up in different situations.\n“For me, they were outsiders who were unaware they had a right to live like they did,” my father-in-law Paul Cornell says in American exceptionalism. “They helped bring the pain and suffering to the American people.”\nHis mother, as I share in the book, calls that childhood a “dream” and is optimistic about the future of his future husband, Greg Cornell, 43, now a forensic pathologist who has filed two inquiries into the cause of death of his stepfather, Robert Cornell, 77, who succumbed to the virus while he was coming to the U.S. from Mexico three years ago.\nHer statement is followed by some clues to the cause of death for Greg Cornell: an unusual mix of upper respiratory infections in addition to measles, diabetes, and some type of sedative in his system. His death, Cornell says, is attributed to common colds in the Hispanic community. A genetic fingerprint checks have determined it to be a combination of the two, and the infection is not expected to spread to the general population. For most of the medical team who investigated Greg Cornell’s case, that is true.\nNow, Cornell is speaking at the interfaith conference, his first in several years. He is one of several journalists who are on the trip. The more newsworthy topic is the answer to the brain-dead question of whether generations of immigrants felt comfortable with interracial marriage, and he is one of four guests to have addressed this issue, along with former Congressional Democrats and U.S. Senator Herb Kohl, a former secretary of state.\nThe argument that immigrants feel uncomfortable speaking out of turn is perhaps less relevant to Americans today than the issue of how to cope with the shrinking number of immigrants. No longer does “interracial” marriage still exist, or should that be possible? Why is the term used to describe which kind of marriage is right for America?\nThis topic has made a welcome comeback to all of our most productive conversations on immigrants, and there is absolutely no reason for Americans to remain vulnerable to prejudice and discrimination whenever they are asked about interracial marriage. The authors of the widely used debate on race and immigration in the U.S. for at least two years concluded that the racial atmosphere’s influence on the experience of interracial marriages in the U.S. is different from that of other countries and suggests that a limited message should be sent to those that encounter interracial marriages. No point in perpetuating such ambivalence here.\nThat is what V. Patrick Moore is trying to show in the book. He is a sociologist, university professor, and member of the Stanford University School of Medicine. I met him a couple of years ago at a symposium hosted by Stanford that he will be writing next.\nHappy International Invitational!\n']"
401,‘Sanctuary’ laws are latest immigration battle to draw Supreme Court’s attention,"['A case may have answered a part of the question raised about the city of Denver when a judge ordered a town sheriff’s deputy to return an arrest record from his holster.\nBut it also posed an ominous second question, as investigators in the U.S. Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel likely saw a little bit of what it could find in a phonebook of sorts.\nThe case concerned a 15-year-old boy accused of possessing heroin laced with fentanyl and cocaine. Such drugs are just the tip of the iceberg, but the volume is far greater than the drug police have generally acknowledged.\nThe OLC’s office is looking into whether law enforcement has altered the crime-detector database of juvenile offenders or whether juveniles bring to their homes drugs from their mothers, fathers or stepmothers, the OLC says.\nWhat spurred the OLC to examine the son’s arrest record is unclear. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives says it has tracked 107 cases in which juvenile arrests were made. Only four of those — 14 from 2011 to 2015 and three from 2016 — were logged at the desk of the jail.\nDenver Police Chief James Holmes ruled Thursday the boy “mixed success” in the boy’s apprehension. But OLC officials say otherwise.\n“His confession as a juvenile convict had proved to have a ‘minor likelihood of success’ in the case,” Holmes wrote in a decision detailing his decision to seek re-incarceration. “It is believed that his friends and neighbors, especially children of both genders, were coached by investigators to alter their criminal history.”\nAs a result, the case is now in federal court as a result of the high court ruling. Holmes, in explaining his decision, is saying that last year’s indictment of a juvenile who supplied the crack cocaine and fentanyl with fentanyl was not a “injury that continues to jeopardize juvenile detention opportunities.”\nThe federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is looking into if that conviction, and the other recent arrests, were consistent with student record-keeping. The attorney general has said the agent’s discovery was significant and that the agency will request a court-authorized search warrant to obtain such information.\nThe boy, James Bennett, has lived in Alamosa for three years while his family is being investigated for the felony sale of fentanyl. Prosecutors said he participated in a seven-count indictment that accused him of facilitating dozens of other dealers.\nProsecutors said Bennett knew he needed to contact his sister and stepmother, and would show the kids about their drug habits.\nAuthorities said Bennett provided electronic monitoring device to his stepmother.\nProsecutors also are seeking information on the child’s parents, as well as a search warrant for the son’s cell phone and school records.\nAldo Svaldi: 303-954-1410, asvaldi@denverpost.com or twitter.com/aldosvaldi\n']"

Tom Coburn has been retrained, died at age 72, and will be missed as was the former congressman.\nFellow Mr. Coburn fans will remember his vocal, multi-million-dollar defense of federal regulations and funding that were required under an old law called “administrative remedies.”\n“Sen. Coburn worked to help states protect themselves from unnecessary and unnecessary burdens,” the senate majority leader said during a recent speech to attendees of the Oklahoma Association of Regulatory Agencies. “And he saw the need to be a counterweight to President Donald Trump's regulatory proposals to expand the nation's domestic oil and gas production.”\nThe general public will recall Coburn’s underdog stance against President Obama’s plan to deregulate fracking – the radioactive gas flowing from shale oil and gas, hitting home with environmentalists that the fossil fuel industry had extracted so illegally, his defence failed - but for Coburn, that was also a staid side of him.\nWith many friends and supporters across the nation as well as friends of the senator’s family, the news was not nearly the victory lap for the younger, articulate, political neophyte; it was, for Coburn, a crushing blow to his hapless electorate that came in the midst of a three-term term, a bit of a singularly partisan and ideologically driven race for a general seat.\nHis competitors and congressional friends found him to be a difficult political target because the Democratic parties were ready to nominate a man who, given decades of experience in Washington and the depth of the U.S. Senate, was more likely to be effective in the poor mire of his electorate than a man with a job fulfilling his clientele’s job description.\nFor a senator who at last had to pay homage to his individual best friend and mentor, who many see as the most qualified member of the legislative body, Coburn found his way into both the Oklahoma Senate and the House of Representatives.\nSince the fall of 2010, the Senate has thrived as its closest, trusted ally, particularly in the fiscal arena, where its fiscal responsibility has given it a sense of confidence that not only can it manage its financial affairs for the long term, but they can pick up the tab for health care at a time when most other Americans can only bear to watch.\nThe Senate has been the long term family of the Republican party in Oklahoma since the 1930s and in the early 20th century. The distinction is an inheritance. Some argue that it belongs to an earlier generation that established and sustained those relationships.\nIt was voted into office by male members of the House and President Barack Obama for the second time. Those in the House of Representatives are beginning to feel the same feel of dignity from Coburn and his staff.\nWhen Coburn’s team began to get seriously involved in the energy debate, those who had long predicted his arrival were thrown back to the abysmal 2012 race for governor, leaving an irony there that could get them back to their last places in state politics.\nJust ask myself, as Senator, of which there has always been: I don’t know how to prepare for this, but I am feeling a little of a contract shock from a potential loss of residence. Perhaps, somewhere out on the strip of San Juan, I should be thankful that it is not as plain as someone wants it to be…Somewhere out in the middle of nowhere.\n""]"
403,Trump signs $2 trillion coronavirus bill into law as companies and households brace for more economic pain,"['THE tax bill entered the U.S. Senate on Monday with the “President on Bin Laden” signs emblazoned across all 21 senatorships in support of a bill that aims to turn around Washington’s sluggish economy, a smaller government and the removal of Obamacare penalties for people signing up for government health insurance.\nInitial projections said the bill to replace the Affordable Care Act would result in net savings of $1.6 trillion over 10 years, pushing the U.S. economy even deeper into the economic decline.\nBut after Republicans stripped away Obamacare’s cost-sharing reduction subsidies, consumers soon started paying more tax on their medical bills because of the generous subsidies and the law’s tax deductibility, a reflection of the burgeoning economic slowdown.\nThe political fallout from Obamacare’s demise shows how fragile the economy is. In a sign of how little the health law’s provisions about insurance exchanges and doctors’ groups have lost ground, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos this week called for a congressional investigation.\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with business leaders and first responders in New Jersey at the State Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S., January 27, 2019.

It aims to end the restrictions on insurers’ business practices that they push for, while they aim to rein in the company culture that developed and nurtured Obamacare and create better health insurance options for consumers.\nThe legislation was crafted by a Democratic leader, Sen.

404,Inside Trump’s risky push to reopen the country amid the coronavirus crisis,"['WASHINGTON (AP) — As the toxic mercury storm started rolling up the blue mist over Washington D.C., President Donald Trump faced a brutal end to his four-day campaign. But one thing has come free of all those elements that were let down during the intense heat of the campaign: He won’t reopen the National Guard and Foreign Service to allow Congress to enact health care legislation.\nHe turned a blind eye to the Ebola outbreak from day one. At his inauguration in January he pardoned an American executive who had been convicted for killing eight Guatemalans in a drug smuggling operation. Under an Obama administration, Democrats issued a 75-page summary of how the president responded to Ebola, confirming more than 6,000 people in the U.S. died.\nWhen Democrats removed him from office, Trump took a bad lesson from a deadly epidemic that has largely returned to the capital.\nThis week is Trump’s final chance to preserve the electoral integrity of his presidency. The stakes for his staff and the president-elect are daunting: Don’t lose credibility if he can’t prevail over the attack dogs.\nSo if the slow slide into chaos has been shown to be an additional factor, Trump’s appointment of a senior adviser in private counsels has left Congress with quite a ways to go. But it could also open a path to Trump’s inevitable free-falling reputation as a career politician.\nTrump’s business life, his international connections and his erratic behavior have further complicated his chances of cracking the Republican party’s traditional 60-vote threshold for a nomination.\nHis multiple, high-profile criminal investigations, orchestrated ones, the underperformance of his campaign and the Democrats’ ease in avoiding scrutiny for his transgressions have severely damaged his campaign. And many Democrats fear that if Trump lost that political free ride, he would really give up his insider’s ability to make a living out of the complicated world of business.\n“You know when Trump leaves office, it’s a signature time and moment of uncertainty that many Democrats don’t get,” said Jesse Benton, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. “He’s going to be like a super professional and not getting much scrutiny from anybody.”\nStill, plenty of Democrats hope that the move to open the Guard will keep it open, despite Trump’s decision last week to relax restrictions on government-run mental health clinics in some states.\nRepublican Senator Rob Portman said he’s still considering his options as he tries to prepare for a bitterly partisan primary in South Carolina on Friday. His party’s primary is also up for a vote.\nWhile Republicans like Portman are already working to shore up their ranks, the optics don’t look that promising.\nRepublican officials say they are still trying to decipher how Trump is going to handle the fact that he had VIP treatment at his White House in the past — a pledge to the White House staff who oversaw his swearing-in. They say he arrived in a checked bag, carrying security documents like a talking spaniel, even skipping dinner and a late-night meeting with his celebrity guests.\nAt his podium at the State Department, all the pomp and circumstance is cut short as the president steps out of the White House, leaving behind Secretary of State John Kerry, Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson for the ride in a vehicle.\nTrump was in town for the inauguration weekend and never flew into the city, leaving everybody else behind.\nIn the weeks since arriving in Washington, Trump had paid the high price for the worst Ebola outbreak in U.S. history. The toll has been highest in Mexico City, where 149 people died. Dozens of people were taken ill in isolated Texas after initial tests showed no Ebola-like symptoms.\nCongressional Republicans and Trump aides try to tamp down expectations that he’ll complete the biggest overhaul of the Obamacare law in a decade, a looming deadline that fates the GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan and Vice President Mike Pence.\n“The administration is trying to move forward in a coherent way that voters would want,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. “Republicans are trying to rally behind Paul Ryan and that’s what he’s come up with.”\n——\nJohn Miller can be reached at http://twitter.com/APkev\n']"
405,"Midland, Tex., was already reeling from a collapsing oil market. Then came coronavirus.","['The CDC\'s warning that people in Texas will experience a coronavirus epidemic after a blizzards-like outbreak around April 1 indicates that most residents of the continental United States are still recovering from the September and October illnesses, and might not benefit from the upcoming winter rush to recover from the warm winter. In total, more than 2,100 people in 33 states with seasonal carriers are thought to have swelled to 33 patients who got sick in three places over the last six months.\nWhat this doesn\'t tell you, though. It helps to quickly identify the source of the virus and tell the person who\'s infected if they\'re still an individual. This important diagnostic tool is especially handy as Medicaid workers are likely to be called upon in case of a massive shortage of nurses in Texas or other states.\nEven if these people had not gotten sick in hospitals, they could have gotten well enough to develop illness that will in turn be detrimental to their health. Alabama and Florida have been hit more hard by the continental cold and flu outbreaks. The southern states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee have seen their populations drop a combined 46 percent from the 1987-1992 influenza outbreak.\nThose in this condition probably had no idea that they might develop this infection for the first time. Yet the CDC isn\'t so sure they know if they can track down the person in their group. Most people infected in this form -- and the only exception is in people who are elderly, under 65, or have cystic fibrosis -- are very lucky. The germs in all of these individuals usually become sufficiently invaderable in the second year of symptoms.\nHowever, the researchers at the Veterans Affairs Health System in Maryland found that in mid-July 17, about 50 people were infected with WPCV, a well-known form of the virus that last 10,000 to 20,000 years before it was discovered.\nAs to why it\'s imperative to think about getting vaccinated against an infectious disease that doesn\'t happen so often, patients at this point in their lives know the clues.\nThe first clue was how they got the virus. People in mid-July with seasonal carriers at the end of their reporting period began coughing up fat about three weeks after arriving in this state. Typically, early in the season, sick people begin spreading the virus to their family members. But a wild time of spring, severe weather and the migration of breeding volunteers mean a change in the timing of their new carriers.\n""The ones that had seasonal carriers probably didn\'t have a lot of fecal fecal clearance when they first came into this area,"" said Dr. Bernard Brezmyer, a pathologist and senior CDC senior scientist.\nSo even if you think your doctor might have reported a flu-like illness to you, it\'s not a real warning.\nGetting vaccinated against seasonal viruses is just a little easier than getting stung by the turkey that\'s left over in the refrigerator because birds\' thirsts are becoming too intense.\nToday\'s type of virus is especially bad on birds because they play a vital role in determining prey and the time when they\'re healthy enough to eat. Some strains of virus are found on populations of poultry, but there\'s no way to predict the chances of a wild bird infecting another species.\nSo don\'t wait until you have the virus to get vaccinated -- because your friends will tell you if you\'re turning the bird over. So if you see this glimmer of hope, don\'t wait -- it\'s probably important to see your doctor right away so you\'re getting the vaccine the next time you\'re in the position of being infected.\nHealth-care professionals should also watch for the emergence of flu-like symptoms when the virus has reached the elderly or sick. Those who are developing it tend to stay on antibiotics, so it\'s not good to hear about getting an infection between weeks and months before you get sick. However, those who\'re developing it shouldn\'t panic.\nThere\'s no guarantee that you\'ll be able to get vaccinated. In general, preventing illness among healthy people is a major step in preventing serious and potentially fatal illness.\n']"
406,The left makes a grudging peace with massive rescue package,"['CLEVELAND (AP) — The United States offered help and assistance to a devastated town in East Timor after pledging to supply water and food, as well as provide medical care and even football.\nBut not everyone expected the Westpac-led plane rescue crew, its calm before the storm that overwhelmed the country’s airport, to get anything closer to a few thousand people from some of the worst hit neighborhoods, including the massive Sugar Hut.\nThe plane turned around and it was unscathed. A few miles to the east, unorganized rescuers who have erected tents, shovels and spotlights into neighborhoods crammed with refugees are still waiting for a U.S. plane.\n“It’s like a shocking thing,” said Diana Fuselle, a human rights lawyer who helped organize the group of women and children whose parents have been in the area for years.\n“I have no idea how to give (the U.S.) hands,” she said.\nThe United States offered aid and help and even provided food and water. In December, the Westpac-led plane carried more than 250 people to the Red Cross housing program in Taura. U.S. Marines also helped people with medical needs.\nIn San Francisco, San Mateo County adopted one of its own after the winter cold brought many in recent years to their neighborhood with snow and mosquitoes, causing an outbreak of El Nino’s swine flu in the region.\nNearly 3,000 people moved there in 2017.\nA U.S. Army corpsman who has been training East Timor’s army forces said the fighters came from across Africa as they last year began their military mission. A gathering of other American and Westpac servicemen left Monday, with roads slowly opening to all traffic, and the need for aid surged.\nThere were about 500,000 people living in Timor with no power, had fallen and said fewer people went to shelters or water. Some families have had their homes destroyed, some have lost their homes to war.\n“Obviously, it’s a tragedy, but not an enormous tragedy,” said Brig. Gen. Philip Atalla, commander of Westpac’s Combat Support Activities division. “We are going to try to do everything that we can to try to get people out of there.”\nAfter the air rescue, Maj. Derrick Thompson, who was deployed to the U.S. Army Corps last year, said he felt “part of me, part of America, and part of my family, was in and part of myself.”\n“I feel optimistic that the thing that is happening in East Timor, despite the tragedy, is working,” he said.\nThe East Timor crisis began when a powerful earthquake struck on Dec. 9. The U.S. Army Corps was brought in after then-President Jose Ramos-Horta ordered a military military coalition to help the Burmese military defend against a Tuareg separatist uprising in neighboring Papua. The alliance was also supported by Fiji, with Australia and Brazil helping with plane evacuation to the restive South Pacific nation.\nLast year, the military received more than $17 billion in aid from the Asian giant and most countries in the region, but only one military military deployment — an exercise in Vanuatu.\nAward-winning poet and poet Frank, who moved to Westpac’s urban neighborhood from Trinidad in 2002, was following the team’s courier trip. “When they saw me from the outside, I know that this is me,” he said.\n___\nAssociated Press writers David Pittman in Washington, Paul Archambault in San Francisco, and Katherine Crump in New York contributed to this report.\n']"
407,These ‘mission critical’ federal employees and contractors are still reporting to the office. They’re terrified they’ll get sick.,"['DURHAM, N.C. (WNCN) – Federal employees and contractors working in Texas are hearing about delayed reports and worsening conditions in their states but are worried they will get sick and be unable to work for the next several weeks.\nThe union representing federal workers at USA Fight Hunger is calling for federal officials to explain why this year, the workplace has “fallen significantly short” of productivity.\nIf you aren’t one of the workers at USA Fight Hunger’s national headquarters, there is a chance you are a friend or contractor working at USA Fight Hunger’s Texas office. Employees were outraged and say they want nothing to do with this program.\nAccording to documents, workers in this one Texas position are experiencing headaches and pain, battery issues, exposure to heat, mould, a a minor stroke and over 80% of their time and hourly wage spent in work areas without a pay raise. Employees were also recently diagnosed with Legionnaires’ disease, which is among the top ten pneumonia and flu related illnesses in the nation.\nThe rest of this year’s work area is expected to remain light. Workplace backlogs are also high and the scale of recent vacancies, the largest among the 32 states that USA Fight Hunger serves is expected to increase by 14% when seasonal fill starts, increasing the percentage of Americans visiting headquarters.\nThis is particularly true in places like Texas, where offices close, patients wait for work to arrive and workers are routinely delivered to work by ambulance with cell phone service, but monthly salaries have lagged behind what they are enjoying.\nThe National Bureau of Labor Statistics says the average monthly cost of hospital care in Texas is $25.7, while West Virginia is above $26.74; and Washington, D.C. and California are still ranked among the worst states in terms of the average cost of healthcare.\nIf all these drivers worked at USA Fight Hunger’s Texas office, they would cost about $480,000 a year. The most recently reported budget impact to USA Fight Hunger was a $20 million annual wage increase for the Texas expansion team in Texas.\nFor his part, Dallas-based USA Fight Hunger and Turner Corporate Solutions said the issue is “a smaller issue than in the past for our teams.” A spokesperson for USA Fight Hunger, whose employees work in Texas and California, did not respond to requests for comment.\n']"
408,Trump seeks to ramp up production of medical equipment after harsh criticism of his slow response,"['President Donald Trump has ordered the U.S. military to be ready to more quickly convert medical equipment needed for emergency response in areas in which, so far, the military has limited to a mere 9.3 inches of coverage.\nThe Pentagon has more than 200,000 medical professionals supporting military and local government around the globe, a number that has yet to grow to the full potential.\nThat has made it particularly difficult for the military to fund biomedical research and other services needed to properly support the spread of critical medical care.\nOfficials in New Mexico and Texas worry their buildings and buildings will have to be turned over to the U.S. Marine Corps’ medical tech arm even more quickly, as they have to move services and equipment.\nIn a move this weekend that both agencies are planning to call for, the Army will carry out an integrated response to customer requirements, starting with last week’s announcement that it will fund $500 million worth of a timeline for getting this equipment to employees and contractors. The program is also expected to contract another $250 million worth of military medical services to contractors after 2020, making it the largest deployment of medical technology in decades.\nThe infusion of federal funds will bolster the U.S. Army Medical Care System, which operates clinics and runs clinics.\nArmy officials are revamping the system at a cost of $4.8 billion. That will include replacing 225,000 of the overgrown dead parts of the Army’s aging tanks, according to a report that was prepared by the Army’s director of national intelligence.\nThe decision comes a day after former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, an Army colleague of Trump’s, said at a congressional hearing that the White House’s slow response to medical emergencies would force military leaders to send more personnel to medical facilities across the country.\nA February report by the Pentagon inspector general showed that after receiving more than 1.1 million warning letters, more than 200,000 were sent to three of the country’s major civilian hospitals, claiming hospital failures, delays in completing medication testing and monitoring of doctors’ procedures. Two of the surgeries that were delayed resulted in radiation therapy, a procedure that should have been approved to treat leukemia, according to the report.\nThe Electronic Medical Records Act was introduced in 2010 to secure federal funding for medical technology with advanced hardware and new capabilities. But congressional Republican spending legislation that President Donald Trump vetoed in November has been blocked by an analysis it had provided, including an $8.9 billion proposal to allocate $4.5 billion for fiscal 2020. It would give the Army $500 million if a backlog of severely medical care delayed completion of products like spinal replacement surgery and two-dimensional self-diagnostics lab tests performed on lab specimens is cleared, according to the Army proposal.\nThe formation of the military medical technology chain is one of the government’s many corporate and individual projects that aim to expedite efforts to become the first big customer for electronic medical devices, including RFID, sensors and sensors used for health care.\nThe Trump administration has shifted the military equipment off-duty, so that it will be handling medical systems much more efficiently. If approved, the chain would be one of several changes to the military healthcare system, as the bulk of its operations would move to civilian government agencies.\n']"
409,"Trump ties grievances with GM, governors to coronavirus decisions","['By Sarah Klein\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump\'s administration responded on Thursday to allegations in a new report from the Treasury Department that the administration withheld or delayed memos dealing with Cadillac safety recalls that said the automaker had accepted responsibility for problems.\nThe internal staff memo mentioned some aspects of Cadillac Inc.\'s new recalls, including the ignition switch problem that led to idling cars and forcing Nissan Motor Co and General Motors Co to recall additional vehicles, which the Washington Post reported on.\nIt said the documents could have done more harm than good and that other decisions made in the government\'s planning process should also have been deferred by the government.\nA Department of Transportation spokesman, Frederick Johnson, said the department supports the paper.\nBoth Ford Motor Co and GM issued written statements responding to the book published last week by Bloomberg News and Washington Post.\nShares of both companies fell as much as 3.3 percent in premarket trading, while Ford was down about 1.2 percent and GM was up 0.8 percent. Shares of GM fell about 1.5 percent, with guidance from investors downplaying concerns about delayed recalls and growth in the U.S. domestic market.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe memo published by Bloomberg follows an internal memo by Treasury Department officials, one of which said that Republicans had pulled the approval of a $7 billion transportation safety plan for GM, saying the money wasn\'t authorized, partly because a bill requiring oversight, would violate agency rules.\nBloomberg reported on Thursday that the Trump administration had made a move in response to that memo, which blamed Cadillac for refusing to stop recalling gas pedals.\nBloomberg said the administration wanted to keep costs low and has decided to leave negative congressional estimates on capital costs and fuel efficiency, as well as fuel efficiency targets under development to encourage more new models.\nThe company said it was considering the claim, and it could have made a ""substantial penalty"" on its shareholders, including CEO Mary Barra, if it found internal memos to the administration wrong.\n""The law prohibits government agencies from making their own public assertions and returning documents without congressional approval,"" Cadillac said in a statement.\nBarra said in an emailed statement to Reuters: ""We have stood our ground and exercised every option available to us and will continue to do so.""\n(Reporting by Sarah Klein; Editing by Richard Chang)\n']"
410,"Inside the talks on the largest U.S. bailout: frantic negotiations, partisan tensions and a Trump tweet","[""Guevara’s probe may have already cost U.S. taxpayers $318 billion. But the political, cultural and economic dynamics may have had something to do with the outcome.\nThe WTO’s official WTO negotiating team, working to keep Michel Barnier’s push for $111 billion in funding for the U.S. General Services Administration and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families programs at bay, sent a congratulatory letter to Trump and AIG CEO Hank Greenberg in March that invoked the company’s heavily criticized self-imposed silence on the rest of the markets in a matter of weeks.\n“We appreciate the constructive spirit of the letter and hope that your continued monitoring of the global financial markets will be a source of much comfort to the Administration,” the WTO’s Guevara told U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a member of the negotiating team, a day after the letter was sent to Trump and the rest of GSA.\nAs Congressional Republicans set off the White House’s morning session for a closed-door meeting this morning, trying to hammer out the precise details of how to beat the Trump administration’s “failing hand,” the WTO opened the process last summer with the bombshell revelation that the Trump administration had broke WTO rules by caving in to demands from traders and saps investors of their profits.\nWith big differences in jurisdiction and stateside priorities, the allies — including Russia, China and Korea — ultimately chose not to challenge WTO rules but to hold a two-day interim meeting to quickly respond to new WTO requests for asset forfeiture programs and checks on financial transactions.\nIn a rare show of bipartisanship, the bipartisan task force played a crucial role in the failed trading process. The two U.S. allies recommended a set of principles of non-discrimination, but the WTO rejected that claim because it had no robust data for how specific interventions were being undertaken and didn’t cover much of global supply and demand.\nThe issue was clearly weighed as U.S. treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin underlined the view that bringing in more federal funding for global financial services would help the American economy.\n“I am very impressed with the WTO’s willingness to take up these very important questions about public finance,” Mnuchin said. “I think it’s very clear to us that we would not accept additional restrictions on the economies of countries that have large financial support programs for international institutions.”\nFor the Commerce Department, the WTO act put into place the massive dismantling of American reliance on certain markets of other countries. Unlike in the past, the WTO deal includes some effective trade protection programs:\n- Where a country is too big to sell its services to other countries, the WTO itself has used WTO rules to restrict imports of Western Europe’s agricultural, natural resources and other commodities.\n– How the free-market environment, which focuses on both cuts and increases, can adjust quickly. The Supreme Court in 2016 signed off on provisions giving the WTO authority to slice through special terms.\n- How uneconomic new technologies are supposed to be used to boost exports from countries that see them as a competitive threat. Congress clearly favors consumer protection, something U.S. officials say the administration was pushing for in the deal.\nAs Congress was also examining the issue, the Commerce Department began setting its own priorities. The WTO-K Street task force has begun to push big markets for domestic companies and big banks that may be required to provide long-term capital support, in addition to checks on payments.\nIn February, the WTO pledged to submit a report by Sept. 15 on the central goals. An eventual report is expected in May.\nNews of the project to the United States and Canada’s response started swirling last week as trade rivals lambasted the WTO’s impenetrable opacity.\nFrance called it “concerning,” Britain challenged it, and Germany announced it would follow suit. The European Commission sent a letter to Apple and other tech firms about concerns about the proposed rules.\nAnd more on tariffs:\nFull text of the WTO's letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\n""]"
411,Finger counting and visitor-gallery seating: House leaders go to extraordinary lengths to outflank lawmaker and pass rescue bill,"['OTTAWA — Leaders of the House of Commons packed the House of Lords with their squadrons of volunteers and emergency staff as the excruciatingly slow recovery process for MPs from the House of Commons ended Tuesday, sending 26 to hospice care and nine to search-and-recover on the steps of the Capitol.\nAs the House chamber operated on the threshold, as nearly 800 bird birds occasionally looked exhausted and dead from bird feces and debris fell onto their study cabinets and onto their faces, leader Kevin Flynn emerged from the first floor and called on the help of another congressman for guidance.\n“Please, Mr Speaker, please help. I’m with the House of Lords,” he told the visitors, who numbered about 200, with five participants in perch on opposite sides of them.\n“The House is important for the country. We try to be. We will always be. We don’t rest in the House of Lords.”\nHe noted the many inconveniences his office encountered during the recovery process and that a considerable fraction of the staff were members of the House of Lords, including the people directly involved in the operation.\nFlynn served in the Commons for six years, most recently as Speaker.\n“Well, the House is all kind, no question about it,” said Flynn, who told the guests they would “do all the hard work” to get them back as soon as possible.\nThe former Defence Secretary, who led the effort to lead Parliament’s recovery from a protracted winter storm, was forced to suspend his office earlier this year after demanding the return of a meeting with Mr. Flynn.\nWhile the unusual hectic time-frame set by Mr. Flynn was reserved for the critical votes on the massive rescue bill — a medical survey bill that includes 35 missing, injured and unaccounted for House Members — experts said it could turn out to be a government-backed disaster.\nParts of the legislation — which the Commons is debating as of Tuesday afternoon — could still be abused on Parliament’s floor, said Rep. Lori Lori Hirono, who represented the Conservatives in the Alberta riding of Maple Ridge and lives in Ottawa.\n“There was a time when two members of Parliament were killed in the House of Commons. Now it’s more than a handful who get hurt in a rush,” said the 41-year-old NDP Leader.\nOn Monday, a retired former Ottawa RCMP officer, Dr. Mark Cummings, whose grandfather famously died when the OPP killed three Sault Ste. Marie constables, was killed in a shooting at Parliament’s Bloor Street headquarters.\nIn a Montreal-area community, where many winter tourists book charter flights to St. Catharines to visit their families, Mr. Cummings, whose grandfather, a regular traveller, has died, said the future of the House could hang in the balance.\n“There could be a loss of his descendants in the House. There could be a loss of his legacy of the House of Commons, of his loyal, honourable, humanitarian service in the military,” he said.\nMr. Cummings is seeking a second term in the House, which makes up 12 per cent of the Commons’ House of Commons.\n“I just don’t think it should be able to go on,” said Rep. Tim Cendreau, who served as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s chief aide from 2008 to 2014.\nHe said Mr. Flynn was at least responsible for other senior members.\n“It just shows the level of faith that we have in all those officers. These people were in the House of Commons helping to keep the family safe,” he said.\nThe House majority was elected from the Free Press’ 85th assembly in 1991 and was elected to two vacancies, meaning most MPs qualified to hold their seats for another 10 years.\nA vacancy in the House could mean either majority leader or minority leader, but it won’t be known until the vote was over.\n“I am sick and tired of people complaining about this,” said Rep. Bob Stewart, who represented the New Zealand riding of Danes for 13 years.\nBut having those members “out there doing what they’re doing, having smiles on their faces, giving back,” Mr. Stewart said of his colleagues, “for them we always have to fight for what we’re fighting for.”\nghoekstra@postmedia.com\n']"
412,Global evacuation crisis tests the State Department — and the patience of Congress,"['The war in Iraq, that scourge of the democratic process, is dominating global media attention in the United States. Despite the magnitude of the crisis, the media continues to focus on national catastrophes.\nAt the United Nations, particularly on the Middle East, the time has come to counter this negative portrayal. Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, chair of the House delegation of the United States, went to Baghdad on Thursday to ask the government of Iraq to step up its security. In response, the government of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) took on some major American companies.\nThe Trump administration is currently conducting a ballistic missile threat check – called a preliminary alert – which has been cancelled by various US diplomatic missions abroad. The State Department said that it is doing a “very thorough assessment of the situation” as confirmed by the secretary of state, Kirstjen Nielsen. The shutdown of the entry and departure sections of the United States indefinitely was deemed appropriate.\nThe conflict also hits the sovereigns of two important countries: Turkey and Azerbaijan. Ankara’s recently elected President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is a military hero and a staunch supporter of US and coalition foreign policy.\nThe situation on the ground in Turkey is very different, which is why it is calling on Washington to act, in public or in private. “We are asking for the Turkish government to act swiftly on ground now,” the Turkish-American envoy told CNN.\nWashington, traditionally indifferent to relations between Washington and its neighbours, has always acted against Ankara whenever an ally or ally expresses serious concern about a military crisis in Turkey. When, as this year, US President Donald Trump directed the military to withdraw “selectively” from Syria, Erdogan defiantly embraced his Turkish ally’s position. From Washington’s perspective, the situation in Turkey seems to be the manifestation of US new ultra-libertarianism.\nRosa DeLauro, Labour Chairwoman and Independent – Massachusetts Representative, leaves Bush Hall before speaking at a vigil for Chardon. Photo by Nellie Wang/AFP/Getty Images\nYet, on Friday, the Justice Department tweeted that US courts were ordered to take the case on February 8, 2020, as a public holiday.\n“Chief US Magistrate Judge R.J. A. Bush ordered the standstill order on 12 February 2020,” the department said in a statement. “The termination of the standstill order, however, was due to a threatened detention order and a pending application in a pending new anti-terrorism order.”\nThe US Supreme Court has already decided not to overturn the decision to uphold Bush’s decision, however.\nThe US government would not ordinarily take this decision lightly. “Here is the historical precedent: the United States has ordered the release of a non-believing child in this country so we can secure his release,” Spanish President Sergio Mattarella stated on Friday in a weekly press conference.\nIn the event, the case for detaining a child remains open. Either way, the US government has other options available that must be examined. “The law allows the detention of children before the end of their school days. No child will be left behind,” officials said in a statement.\nBut the legal situation could take a severe blow to US policy: the current American court system already has record of deciding anti-immigrant immigration cases, compared to the decades-long line of immigration cases routinely rejected in international courts.\nBecause the US already has plenty of justices who rule on anti-immigrant immigration cases, it’s best that justice is busy.\nLast 5 posts by Jason Ditz\n']"

He has resigned from these roles with the decision to mount a major attempt to rally the government’s response to the Fukushima nuclear disaster.\n“What has happened to the Australian dollar? We are now facing a new, unprecedented period of domestic political tension,” said Hunt. “We do not need a busy conservative government to fix these issues.”\nThe reduction in international exchange rates, the steady increase in mineral exports and the continued negative interest rates on deposit prop up the Australian dollar. The value of the Australian dollar is now around $1.04, against the US dollar of $1.3268, which is now worth 85% more than 90% of the arb against the dollar.\nMorris has been quiet on the crises in the U.S. and has pursued a policy of containment, but has instead been tacking on policy aimed at protecting a sort of social safety net throughout the world, as advocated by the government. He did say in the week of March 11 that he had instructed the Treasury secretary to seek the abolition of the multilateral listing system, arguing that the government was too lax with the International Monetary Fund.\nDue to climate change the Government should not allow the financial sector to increase the cost of importing food by more than 90% when millions of people, including baby boomers, live on low incomes. This is not fair because they will never even grow their food because a recent increase in oil prices led to a shift in expectations towards greater food security.\nThe conservative counter, the White Paper, the major proposal to eliminate nuclear power at our existing power stations, is a well thought-out initiative, the central plank of the agenda, and supported by Hunt.\nAs Minister for National Programs, Hunt says an ideal outcome would be an Australia and North Korea trade free from nuclear sanctions which have been a potent strategy of the past 20 years. In fact, Hunt and other policy analysts believe that Japan would suffer the most, China could suffer the most and the West could suffer the least when they trade for trade with the former Soviet Union.\n']"

His mother asked about his condition but he said: “I am calm.”\nWhen he told his parents he was fine they were both embarrassed.\nSoon after his return they called the police and his father called the deputy inspector of A Company of People. He was arrested and charged with a breach of the peace.\nThe incident brought together an experience of friendship and not so much of friendship towards a Dublin job which built him up to the personal connections he later enjoyed in Cork.\nThe case made him feel needed to receive a special favour from an Irish woman and his mother, it did not end there, though.\nThe great Tim Flannery convinced Kane to return to Ireland and, despite not having a permanent home, he also enjoyed some home hospitality.\nTests after his bailiffs put out a complaint to the police uncovered his heavy personality and some inconsistencies in the marriage. Eventually his wife was summoned and tried in the city, as were his father. The verdict was that only his wife could carry on taking care of him.\nAfter her marriage was dissolved at the end of September 1974, he moved into its flat and, as expected, he quickly moved into his parents' home.\nThe great Tim Flannery brought him into his parents' home as a guest and later in him after a long stay in his family home.\nSince he returned to Dublin, his friends moved in with him over the years, he was regularly expected to take a group of friends out for a walk on a bus.\nThe Chicago Tribune reported that the man experienced onset of Alzheimer's disease in 1957. His memory problems had finally failed and he was unable to recall very quickly events in the past few years.\nHis sons had problems with socialising in the house, a slow house life, several doctors went out at night, various “tentative problems with fancy clothes and dental procedures”, mental state, marriage, Irish exams, and came too late to marry him.\nIn 1952, we heard about a husband’s ordeals. They moved to Dublin to be closer to a daughter who was in the United States and had tried for twenty years to make her come to Ireland and meet her. They got married to a daughter.\nShortly after wedding and after the starting of their marriage Paul was married to Sue. There were five children between them.\nPaul was an educated man, with a career and ambitions that fit up well with his Irish background. His rugby union successes often informed his Irish teaching of music and English as a coach.\nHis older brother, Sir John, is a pupil at Lincoln High School.\nThe case put the family on the world map and soon their daughter began to experience and also develop as an Irish girl.\nHer marriage to Charlie from their early twenties was arranged around the time of her first marriage in 1971. She began a pattern of marital problems, and worked for the next couple of years as a nurse with specialised hospitals.\nAfter returning to Ireland in 1988 Paul received the formal due of his Irish citizenship.\nHis father’s welfare was changed in the wake of his deportment in Ireland in 1988, and the delay in Paul’s departure to Ireland was also influenced by his educational history.\nHis sisters were only able to arrange a single appointment in Ireland for a road service from their father’s home.\nAt the age of 21, he turned his attention towards his future, becoming a full-time lecturer and master of law at the University of Limerick. He applied for a commission on the grounds that he had failed to bring his English skills up to the level required in Irish law and had neglected his Irish nationality.\nAfter his teaching career he still wrote to St Andrews University to express his delight about his future as a partner.\nPaul experienced Irish experience, particularly during his international hours, at the lecturing hours, and in the classes where he was practising.\nHis father was involved in a cross border smuggling syndicate as well, and his mother was another financial support body.\nAlways a strong woman, he had a great warmth and the utmost love for his close friends, even the ones who never left him.\n""]"

The team that selected CCC, with some undeniable talent and charisma, has a desperately popular card up there on the back of its lineup. And if it is a promo card, as they have, it is a Star Wars certified for track and field promotion. Now why not, Star Wars-equipped, lest we forget?\nBut should fans of the band turn to Standing Rock for a protest when they feel the area is not enough. Outside of its military training and work environment, Standing Rock operates as an outlet for displaced people. One very loyal and passionate Standing Rock fan, ask him about the situation in the area, is in fact not alone.\nTwo days after the Exxon Valdez oil spill, the oil carriers and the Shell workers bused in landed without warning. Yet, with all of the ashen equipment and even partisan counterpunchings on its behalf, Standing Rock is now facing community backlash and a serious mobilization of citizens to the streets. Namely, the response the band, the public, grassroots and political climate seems to be channeling – a lack of concerned outrage and denialism to commit acts of creative destruction.\nThis is a release to raise awareness, both in song and performances. Let the reader on the left of the picture know where to look for the new look. If any questions get answered, please feel free to speak your mind. The answer to the First Sunday in April concert is as we told you, in the spirit of “truth is in the air” in the heart of the city, let us start one patriotic outpouring of what, as I said earlier, a band of nasties do. Let us not let ourselves be let down. Let us build off the energy of our fights and work to beat the totalitarian power of government in all forms.\nFor the electric sign signs to be erected on the MLK’s lawn, NBGNS, Mr. Bermsky spoke, by song’s end, at a temporary tent in front of the camping tent at the Green. Standing Rock Parish President Mitch Scharr celebrated MLK by posting a music video with Green music. The next day, Big Green Punk showed up in a circle and shouted at Standing Rock Parish Dean Robertson, Dr. Roberts and other pastors who had planned to take the stage. The folks from Standing Rock College also took time to be there. Members of the college’s High School of Humanities and Politics also were represented.\nAll this garnered some attention. Two standing Rock congregations spread out over the square outside the Green Convention Center to promote the display and urge people to not be silent. In that exchange, however, the most powerful party in the country tried to force a “fortification struggle” on the pro-government activists. In yesterday’s same round of Soundwave, it was the CP, hands down, who thanked “all the volunteers, ” sounding a lot like Dillard’s face.\nIt is not for nothing that Minnesota vs. Illinois was the first legal challenge to a primary electoral map set up by the GOP state legislature. This is for knowing voters who voted for Trump last fall. In fact, though, my favorite moment was the one when one of the captains of the Green endorsed the president. One of the popular slogans of the Green’s purposes is “build coal.” While one claims that coal will take 1,000 coal miners from their mines in North Dakota this coming October and November, the truth is coal is still being produced here. And workers without pay for hours left in coal mines are still paying dirtier rates for their smoke-free hours than the cost of a half-day drive to the polls.\nFor the Green in Maryland, standing in front of the home of Missy Elliott stands as a demonstration of the strength and strength of the people who stand in the memory of Mr. Moore.

The Washington Post reported that many of the homes and apartment buildings have been “stacked up” in disrepair.\nCNN spokeswoman Ruthie Johnsen told the Post, “We are in the building that is our anchor’s studio.

He said the health threat from a potential flu outbreak has “a striking link” with the Great Lakes.\nWashington’s “biggest worry” comes from lower levels of sex, race and native flu in the Middle East, the CDC reports.\n“South Africa now has reported more than 11 million cases over three years,” AP reported. “That’s 21 times higher than the number killed during the relatively brief Middle East respiratory epidemic.”\nFind out more about the vaccine in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\nLGBTQ advocates in Washington are stepping up efforts to fight the confirmation of Trump’s replacement.\nPeople who are living there have reported the absence of the virus in their home and a number of adults are living there, according to Project Project.\nCNN reports, “One of the main people living here is Giancana Cello, a Romanian immigrant whose family moved to DC in the 1960s.”\nThe 9/11 official’s wife believes her husband bought a gun back then. “I saw this gun on my doorstep!” she told CNN’s Elizabeth Ferrer.\nAdvocates are trying to get at the question of whether she’s identified as an anti-gay activist. “The American people have an obligation to come to a political point,” committee chair Beth Maloney told CNN’s Schuyler Jenkins. “It’s unfortunate that gay activists are facing rejection, but the American people deserve to have their voices heard.”\nWomen’s advocate George van Velze said on Twitter, “That weapon was originally mine.

420,Coronavirus collides with Latin America’s maid culture — with sometimes deadly results,"['According to an analysis published in late last year by the Lancet Neurology Journal, high mortality rates have been blamed for a certain problem in the Latin American tourism industry: infectious disease, often linked to maids.\nThe paper, which looked at a database of available data, measured the deaths and number of maids and other migrant workers, and also found that’s not just an unexpected result of working with a co-worker who suddenly became infected with an anoracic chondrochiolitis (ECC), a viral disease that causes diarrhea and dehydration, among other symptoms.\nECC, which is caused by antibiotics, bacteria and parasites that infect the joints and other muscles of the skin, is sometimes fatal in some Latin American countries, but for many cultures it is fatal more often.\nWhile this study was based on records of every 10 percent of the workers from the sixth century B.C. through the 1900s, it did not look at the extent to which their deaths had happened in the entirety of the tourism industry, which has never been proven to be the cause of ECC and typically is not treated. But it could be that it was a result of spreading bug bites on other workers.\nA Case of Immigrant Workers Infected with anoracic Chondrochiolitis\nStill, the study shows that it is common for immigrants’ teeth to wiggle around, and for workers to sometimes diverge from other workers when they are cleaning windows and doors. Workers also often bite or get bitten by someone with ECC.\nThe researchers also talked to a lot of maids over the past several years, and identified how many of the women and men were affected by ECC, without naming names.\nFor every 100 maids or for every 11 maids overall, there were 17 cases of ECC cases among 19 maids, according to the research. In the whole of Latin America, the number of ECC cases rose from over 7,000 in 2000 to over 13,000 in 2017, and around 3,000 cases in 2017.\nThe root cause of ECC isn’t clear, but most of the cases involved a victim catching the infection while working from home, or during the short period of a trip.\nHuman germ cells commonly made by European migrant workers\n“Though they’re not the only migrant workers producing ECC cases, this pattern is likely the same for Latin America,” the researchers wrote. “The epidemic is likely linked to the large number of cases of [ECC cases] in Latin America in recent years.”\nOne of the major factors behind the wave of ECC cases is the fact that immigrants’ teeth and cheekbones are missing from certain jobs, and at times they can easily move on to other jobs with fewer injuries. The researchers found that some people who were more likely to touch this could have been victims of being bitten by a co-worker.\nThe authors of the study of the ECC mortality rates reported it could be that a woman gets infected with the bacteria known as adenosine triphosphate (APD), which then carries into the teeth of other workers, or that the woman is exposed to an anoracic chondrochiolitis outbreak.\nRegardless of where the infected person is, the findings show that ECC mortality rates vary widely and are associated with different cultures, but by that I mean different regions within the region. Still, people generally need to be vigilant about infection spread, and in Latin America specifically those infected by APP are more likely to have fatalities because of the infection.\nPrevious studies found the EB rate to be higher in a variety of countries, but the latest study shows the frequency and severity of the EB rate in Latin America has increased over the past 40 years.\nThere have been other cases of the EB rate in Brazil, Guatemala, Mexico, El Salvador, and even the Honduran border cities, in particular, from the late 1970s.\nWaking up and having your nails done in the City of Industry\nMigrants and citizens in Latin America, which has roughly 88 percent of the population living in urban areas, are especially vulnerable to EB — owing to the high cost of education and the fact that Latin American immigrants pay so much into welfare programs, including international emergency aid.\nAccording to a 2015 report from the the International Longitudinal Study of Migration, 86 percent of migrants who are migrants are over the age of 18. Globally, numbers of immigrants to the cities are also likely to be increasing, especially since less than half of all the migrants reported experiencing ED are workers.\nBut the capital of Mexico has a different relationship with EMET — the workers’ compensation agency (Federales la Chaturrada, la Universidad Perÿtional de Mexicanidad, a division of the Fundación']"

423,Canada debates offering physician-assisted death to patients who aren’t terminally ill,"['TORONTO — The Canadian government is circulating a bill aimed at improving the safety of people who die from certain cancers and promoting end-of-life care for people already on the dole.\nThe bill, if approved, would allow legally assisted terminally ill Canadians to die as soon as they are cleared by health authorities. The proposal to legalize the medical practice for the terminally ill remains in the legislative process.\nOpponents argue that a certain level of assisted dying would be wrong and bad for patients and could prevent them from achieving the desired goals of medical treatment, which include reducing mortality rates.\n“The decision is really what we are trying to get done here — to make sure that healthcare is fully accessible,” said Chrétien NDP MPP Omar Khadr.\n“How many more deaths do you expect from this legislation — with life, life is better than death?”\nCanada’s minister of women’s affairs and the minister of the interior, Navdeep Bains, declined to comment on the bill or its effects on patients. But a statement from Khadr’s lawyer — Anirudh Eslkiran — said it was important to protect the person’s dignity.\n“We believe in the right to live in dignity,” he said.\nCanada’s National Health Care Act mandated the creation of a process for terminally ill people to be charged with a technical measure of their desired treatment. The step makes it possible for patients to obtain medical licenses to obtain end-of-life care, without getting a state-by-state determination. The process would instead be funded through an annual license fee, or “CNG” as it’s referred to in federal and provincial pharmacare bills.\nThe doctor-assisted death bill proposes to create a committee known as the Decision Group to work with health authorities to develop and take over the process for the terminally ill to decide whether to seek help.\nIt would then hear appeals from the medical board, establish a properly appointed institution within the health system to administer end-of-life care and seek support. The decision would be governed by the Health Ministry in consultation with the regional boards of health and the province.\nThe bill also outlines the type of death that would be scheduled, the date, whether or not the person would be able to die or what type of medical treatment would be offered.\nThe bill said that patients who end-of-life the way they choose could qualify for both either an assisted dying centre with a team of medical staff and an individualized “life centre” — based on the criteria outlined in the constitution — or a call-to-arms service that would offer the patient support if they wanted the option.\nThe bill also outlines what remains of the existing family-governance system for cancer patients to qualify for assisted death. That involves discussions with their doctor, followed by each individual — and their family — being approached with the option to have a “life centre” available in their health-care settings.\nIn the past, some provinces — like Alberta and Quebec — have legalized assisted dying, but advocates for patients say the process has been open to wide interpretation.\nIf the bill is approved, it would mean that anyone who dies in self-administration — the name of which Khadr’s lawyers have argued is not his — would be able to take his life without harm inflicted by doctors.\nThat would make ending a loved one’s life without harming anyone else without passing on the death process to the person they wish to die.\nThe HCC is currently largely operational in Ontario, but would soon become available in British Columbia.\n']"
424,Japan uses targeted coronavirus testing; South Korea goes big. The U.S. faces a choice.,"['Japan\'s director of health reported late Tuesday that the government and military have used the world\'s most advanced coronavirus to test samples in its closely guarded military ballistic missile system.\nAt a briefing, he said the launch of the two flights, a launch and a landing in Japan and the test of a carrier-launched missile in South Korea, would send mixed signals that they are cooperating on defense. That the instruments malfunctioned could raise the probability of false positives -- genetic anomalies -- he said.\n""Individually, it is a small exposure,"" and that behavior won\'t change even for years to come, he said.\nA rigorous coronavirus test is in development and deemed medically appropriate because they don\'t use a gene that\'s usually responsible for causing disease, also known as toxic chromatin, said Hidenobu Nagai, spokesman for the National Defense Industrial Security Agency (NDIS). That test involves interviews, isotopes and pulse measurements with sample samples, Nagai said.\nSensing the atmosphere, NNDIS will ""be very, very vigilant and will identify all the genotypes and recommend course of action.""\nJapan and South Korea were targeted, and they\'ve had to turn over more than their own protective gear for testing, Nagai said.\n""We\'re trying very hard to be very sensitive to potential harms -- including both ourselves and the public,"" Nagai said. ""We\'ll make sure the tests are workable, and give advance warnings to the Japanese government.""\nAttention will also be on ""robust"" and ""limited"" vaccines and a ""safe"" vaccine so it can attack any potential tumor with a single shot. The defense agency, charged with detecting and preventing the spread of deadly viruses, has not given details about how it intends to do it, Nagai said.\n""We\'re thinking about enhancing the protection we\'ve been given and standardizing the [female] vaccine,"" Nagai said.\nAt a briefing Tuesday, the NNDIS not only continued to explore the potential positive results of radiation detected on Japanese hands but also expressed that it expects to conclude a test using the same method that was used on North Korea.\nJapanese business leaders and company representatives confirmed earlier this month that foreign companies including Qualcomm Inc. and Johnson & Johnson have tested human samples abroad for high levels of viruses, especially those that can cure cancer.\nJapan\'s atomic arsenal includes more than 20 nuclear reactors. Nuclear weapons accounted for 4 percent of all nuclear energy consumed in the country in 2014, according to an annual survey of Public Health Administration. Japan\'s current weapons load totals about 865,000 kilos of nuclear fuel for 120-megawatt reactors. That figure includes the unit\'s reactor towers, part of the cost to the government of buying the reactors from foreign nuclear-related companies, Nagai said.\nNorth Korea conducted its first nuclear test on Jan. 12 with two sets of nuclear-capable Super-Flash Shelf warheads. Analysts expect that long-range radars there would provide a warning if the H-6 and H-7 nuclear submersibles made in the United States became a fully equipped nuclear missile defense system to target.\nJapanese authorities regularly carry out ""very sensitive"" radiation tests or radiation screening of the network of nuclear laboratories in their government-controlled islands, Nagai said. That is far less focused on nuclear weapons than on biological weapons.\nJapan has had several misdiagnoses since that time -- an explosion in 2009 while handling radioactive isotopes at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant in Japan’s prefecture, east of Tokyo, triggering more than a dozen deaths and thousands of radiation leaks. The government has shuttered what was then two nuclear plants and from which another one runs.\nTo make sure the nuclear probe isn\'t contaminating another, Nagai said the Japanese government should avoid using commercially produced radioactive polonium-210 and plutonium to fight smallpox, as has been done in World War II. And Japanese scientists currently have precise analysis on all types of the virus that can reverse course in an atomic blast, Nagai said.\nA pathogen can\'t wipe out an entire human population when it destroys one victim, but such radiation can ""persuade the brain,"" Nagai said.\nJapan has been relatively spared from nuclear bombing since the 1990s, Nagai said. But nuclear testing has become a growing concern. Last year, after a deadly Fukushima crisis, Japan began using a program designed to detect this deadly cocktail of radioactive radioactive isotopes and found it nearly succeeded.\nJapanese officials are especially concerned about third-party contamination, Nagai said.\n']"

427,US-led forces pull out of 3rd Iraqi base this month,"['The US-led coalition on Tuesday withdrew from the support base off the Iraqi-Syrian border in response to events in the country’s south that became a testing test of the cohesion of the new Iraqi government.\nThe Iraqi troops withdrawn from the 1,060-km (1,530-mile) border with Syria with the endorsement of the Iraqi authorities, amid concerns about the increasing vulnerability of large areas to influx of Kurdish forces after their capture of two northern towns from Daesh in June.\nAbout 300 US-led air and ground forces will withdraw from the base from May 5, officials said.\nThe decision to pull out of the base came as the international community reassessed whether the “burdensome” barriers required to fight Daesh in eastern Syria were in line with international law, among other serious reasons.\nTrump has warned Daesh against moving to the outskirts of the wider city of Raqqa, where it had overrun the city earlier this month, to move quickly before retaking it, in a protest that galvanised an international crisis.\nThe move comes after the US commander in Iraq said there had been “multiple occasions” by Daesh to gain its safe haven near Raqqa.\nBut British and other foreign-led forces, as well as military advisers and militias from across the region, will now leave the base in the coming weeks, with the British mission threatened to withdraw from the area due to any “changes” in conditions.\nRecent statements by Daesh chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi have heightened concerns that the group is opening up a presence in the province on the northern edge of the capital, Mosul, its second major city, which it dominates.\nThe US military does not yet know the impact of such statements in planning or carrying out operations, and it remains unclear how many times the US threat to withdraw from the base is before deployments begin.\n“More deployments will probably take place in the future. I think this will most likely be a voluntary pullout,” Maj Gen Thomas Becket, who will join the US forces in June, told CNN.\nThe situation in Iraq is “much better” than it was three years ago, he said, adding that the stability of Mosul and the safe distance between them would reassure US and coalition forces.\nThe withdrawal of the US advisers comes after it announced the conditions under which it would withdraw some of its advisers from Iraq.\nThe withdrawal of US officials from the base was made in private, not in command, and was approved by the Iraqi minister of national security who speaks Kurdish.\nWith allied forces deployed in Iraq, some other countries have intensified their work in Iraq against Daesh in northern Syria, while Russia has claimed it is fighting the group from remote spots.\nThe withdrawal from the base in Iraq marks a momentous moment for Iraq, as its army began to withdraw from Syria and also left the country in a free hand, after U.S. forces took part in the liberation of Iraq in June.\nRajiv Shah, a senior diplomat in the United Nations mission to Iraq (UNAMID), was expected to be meeting regional envoys in Paris on Wednesday to discuss the ongoing consultations with Iraqi and US officials.\nWashington’s 2018 American military base base in Baghdad was bombed in November when Iranian forces carried out a show of force to retake Mosul, near the Syrian border, which is the location of the Islamic State group’s grand stronghold.\n']"

They mainly come from outside,” Rasheed Binajan, a spokesman for the U.N.’s International Maritime Bureau, told Reuters.\nHe said that if the court system gives militants the benefit of the doubt, they will take the pirates to court, which he said could take years.\n“The only way of estimating the rate of piracy is to imagine that in one year there will be at least one life sentence given by the court in which a suspected pirates found no release or imprisonment,” Binajan told Reuters.\nHe gave no figures for the number of arrested pirates, though he estimated that 140 had been in detention for the last 18 months or more.\n“There are still hundreds still in detention and not even to be released,” said Binajan.\n']"

Council, which heads the city council, has drawn up a vague ordinance that bans discrimination based on “immigrant status” and social mixed-race and “black,” affirmative action, or “religious support for religious organizations.” It is determined by the D.C.

On the hillside where two are being trained, court officers patrol overhead with official pressure-and-assistance bracelets and glass barricades and wait on motorbikes while police vehicles and armoured personnel carriers block up streets nearby.\nOfficials say the curfew will run between three and seven days but contain an intense police presence with riot police, armoured personnel carriers and heavier weapons. An attack on checkpoints may be added to the morning stay as that way could give police a more enhanced risk of disruption.\nEarly on Thursday the Kenya Meteorological Department (KMWD) announced an outbreak of the virus at the town of West Masindi. The UK national alert was downgraded to “high risk” because of the outbreak.\nFew expect the immunisation regime to stop the outbreak but measures are under way including chain-reaction hospital evacuations, system upgrades and the relocation of hospitals.\nDr. Suleiman Kibushi, executive secretary at KMWD, told the TV station that the “red law” (the section that imposes national security) will not be changed until the outbreak is stopped.\n“This is about life and death, the rule that Kenya has not complacently. In the USA the curfew lasts between five and seven days and it is not clear if this security package will last the end of the curfew period,” he said.\nMr. Kibushi said authorities were working to ensure guards and police personnel were not involved in fighting the outbreak. “These phases allow for a limited response by Kenya’s security forces,” he said.\nThe decree allows police to keep separate crowds, restrict access, change barricades and ensure perimeter checks are in place.

435,Militia attacks on Americans in Iraq are becoming more audacious. The U.S. is wrestling with how to respond.,"['WASHINGTON — ISIS has become a bigger menace than the one it carried out in Iraq, and the group is increasingly winning over longtime Iraq reservists who fear they will soon be thrust into a quagmire once they return home.\nAre the militants recruiting more reservists? Can they recruit larger numbers of militants for a growing arsenal? Can they use sophisticated sophisticated attacks to extort money?\nThese were some of the questions that are coming up when a U.S. intelligence official recently spoke to journalists.\nPentagon officials have been wondering for years whether U.S. forces could fight those militant groups in Iraq or even Syria because they often disappear from war-fighting efforts.\nThe difficulty is that the strategies approach is out of step with the pace of the conflicts in that part of the world, which, like Iraq, is also setting up in areas as far away as Egypt and Lebanon.\n“It’s not just a question of how we respond,” said Mark Reuss, a Pentagon spokesman, “It’s actually a question of how we respond to the possible return of those reservists who are viewed as the most courageous warriors out there right now in Iraq.”\nAt the same time, the question is whether the U.S. and the Iraqi government can help them overcome other security challenges that have hobbled them in the short-term.\nThe United States has focused on building a force of its own as part of a larger conflict in Syria, a war that has killed at least 10,000 people, killed tens of thousands of people, displaced over 250 million and dragged in many nations, including Turkey and Iran.\nMilitary experts worry about unintended and difficult actions by the Islamic State that might signal a new threat to the United States. At the same time, the group increasingly may be trying to prove a new identity — that it has family ties in the country or even helped grow it in ways that facilitate the creation of a contiguous future.\nIslamic State militants also have spent years carving out districts across areas of Iraq, driving many into self-governance as they think they can establish a new state. Although the militant group denies all responsibility for the slaughter of innocents, the group has published pictures and videos of civilians being murdered.\nBattered cities and condemned facilities have been destroyed along with some of Iraq’s worst military installations. The U.S. military patrols mostly around Iraq, much of it in the country’s south, pushing the extremists to new territory.\nThe U.S. stepped up its bombing campaign in northern Iraq against IS after three retired generals warned in separate interviews with the Associated Press that Iraqi forces could easily be overwhelmed by the Islamic State group’s prolonged defenses. But they warned that Iraq’s security forces were at risk of collapsing, as IS gains massive military and political strength in its traditional zones.\n“Anywhere we went, there was risk to our own soldiers in an attempt to dissuade them from leaving Iraq,” said Gen. Robert Irvine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Army secretary.\nThe fighting could also add to the war’s problems.\nEstimates of the number of Iraqi civilians killed in the war are conflicting, but a CNN tally put the figure at 2,400 killed on the battlefield in Iraq, largely on the heels of clashes between Iraqi security forces and IS.\nFor the past several years, U.S. forces have offered training to Iraqis who have faced resistance to US military operations in Iraq and Syria. By including such training programs, the Pentagon hopes to deter future acts of violence, much as it did during the ongoing US campaign in Syria.\nBut even if US forces won’t continue to fight IS, there could be upside for the group, with the US and Iraq looking more unstable as they emerge from decades of war.\n“I don’t know if we’ll ever feel safe again in Iraq,” said Reuss. “We’re not just going to take this for granted anymore.”\n']"

From 2005 to 2009, PKY-08 was able to walk the last 60 minutes of a human life, before sweltering streets, an introduction to nature, and a return of their acclimated conditions to a manageable number, as many people shunmed unpaved highways, easy pet trails, and ticket cash cards.\nMany organizations supporting the relief effort then initially began to wind up having some impact. Just after the beginning of fallow, NGOs reported they had cut down 30 percent of their clients from fleeing the highly abnormal disease.\nIn addition, in the absence of action by the government, people were becoming increasingly fearful, many afraid to leave loved ones for fear of going through internal torture or terrorised by financial abuses and sometimes fatal pandemic attacks. Last August, after the onset of the severe flu, some 35,000 families lost their homes.\nWith years of mismanagement and political paralysis, PKY-08 was forced to end in September 2015, when national health statistics published in Asia local to beret\xadrolled by city-level officials not subject to official sanctions.\nSo despite the harshness of the year and a long Lunar New Year, in part due to the poor health of his colleagues, it was unclear how far PKY-08 would advance—if any—during the coming financial chaos that has decimated the safety of millions of people who have lost their homes and businesses, and a further deterioration in the already low quality of food.\nVisitors with channellingis who plan to fly into Thailand, Asia, or the Malaysian mainland will pay only a minimal travel charge, though the added expense that comes with the safe travel can inflict serious psychological effects.\n']"

According to several residents, this is the first time the government has chosen to postpone the screening of a film, even in the face of a ban on it.\nMeanwhile, of the 22 films released so far, five have received a rough green light, ending a stand-off that began in April 2017, when India had to enforce a temporary policy and ban all films that look at the self-professed killing of innocent civilians by the state’s security forces. There have been seven screenings, eight of which have been set aside and two are in post-production.\n“In all, we received 21 films and have been following up the new policy for a year. We are in communication with the state government to take future steps to ensure that the precious time is spent on such films that can be used as a testimonial to the beauty of the state’s culture,” Vibha V Gokhale, Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, said at the presentation of the 48-day screening policy, read by Shivpal Verma, Minister of State for B P Anand Sharma, at the state cabinet meeting.\nIt was decided that films which take place as part of a promotional event or on a voluntary basis will not be screened for 10 days after that. This will raise few questions if the film makers are not careful. Patel assured that the state government would cooperate in this.\n']"

But the upcoming elections are so controversial because of an ongoing massive court case involving alleged corruption and torture at police, judiciary and army detention centers.\nThe authorities have been cracking down on protests in Egypt’s Tahrir Square. Hundreds of thousands of women marched through the streets in May 2018 to protest against the army and the ouster of el-Sisi, as well as prison terms for 14 women caught stealing a car, said Yoani Sesel, a university student.\nThe activists and parliamentarians fighting in recent weeks are members of Yasser Aksel, a human rights activist and one of the parliamentarians who lost to el-Sisi in 2015. El-Sesel, the rights activist, said he has been trapped because of the delay in bringing charges against him, through the country’s independent Prosecutor-General’s Office, and he had been denied asylum in Qatar.\nAl-Watan, Egypt’s leading media outlet, said protesters are not pleased with the Friday deadline in the court case.\n“They hope that the trial will halt or they will be even more furious about it,” the newspaper said in an editorial. “The obstacles ahead are not curtailed by changing elections… Several thousand years ago Egyptian [is] over; we are 100 years (sic) away… Until there is justice, we expect that those who should tell the world that this is a false plot will be rolled back and caught in the courts, but there will be no justice.”\nThey see it as a prelude to a long simmering conflict.\nRights activists accuse the judiciary and the security forces of perpetrating atrocities at police, court and military detention centers, as well as thousands of people in prison, often of the youth group called Yasser Tahrir (“Youth Against Police”).\nLast year, Tahrir Square was among the most important demonstrations this year, with thousands of young people holding events in the square leading up to the presidential election.\n']"

442,Live updates: Trump says federal guidance urging social distancing will stay in place through April 30,"['WASHINGTON — Trump’s new National Security Adviser John Bolton didn’t rule out the possibility of taking the National Security Council’s place as a part of the administration as the public continues to parse out what aspects of Trump’s National Security Council operation they would have to, in effect, consider.\nBolton says the White House doesn’t want the council’s role to be anything less than the post-H.R.P. role that the people who oversee the national security establishment normally have.\n“I think we’ve identified one big point: With Donald Trump’s presidency, whatever happens, Donald Trump is gonna go ahead and run a National Security Council,” Bolton said on Friday. “That’s what I was told that has been presented to him and will be in the future, to his personal staff … and I think he’s going to go ahead and do what he’s doing.”\nTrump did not hold a public news conference and did not say he plans to re-enter politics with state department officials, though the president noted several times he’s a Democrat and had previously spoken of wanting to be a Republican.\n“There’s a lot of discussion going on about where we are and what we do, how we do it, how we do it, and how we do it in a way that is important,” Trump said. “They all have to be agreed on. …\n“I would say all of them have agreed to be in a position where they’re able to do what they’re doing.”\nBolton wouldn’t talk about the president’s decision. But he said Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s public statements that Republicans have gotten out of committee contracts to advance policies that would benefit Democrats, the National Security Council’s role and the voting powers of the National Security Council, show President Trump “rarely disagrees with his orders.”\n“Every letter he’s gotten from the president every single day is intended to allow his staff to work,” Bolton said. “He keeps them engaged, and everybody agrees the voices they represent, they deserve to be heard. He really does. It’s a wonderful thing. And I agree with him. He understood that. He respected that.”\nThat comment is his most direct comment yet about administration policy. At least one White House official said in early April that he hadn’t heard anything directly about where the President is implementing what Bolton said he had been instructed to consider.\nThe White House has made no official comment about Bolton’s comments, but administration aides had said he told them there should be no such thing as another NSC role. The final word on whether Bolton should hold a formal national security role was issued by the National Security Council’s Executive Council, not the National Security Council’s Organization Council.\nTrump on Tuesday night called Bolton “a tough kid, but he’s a brilliant guy.”\nBolton said Trump told him “we’re not going to just leave you in the lurch, but we’re going to bring a very professional person in to give you the direction to go, with respect to building this, with respect to the foreign policy, with respect to the national security umbrella.”\nBolton did not elaborate.

443,Why Germany’s coronavirus death rate is so much lower than other countries’ rates,"['A report by Germany’s national statistics agency casts doubts on why the death rate for deadly deadly coronavirus (VV) has so come down so drastically compared to other countries.\nDeath rates are the rate at which the cause of death is found and compared with other countries.\nAccording to the largest outbreak in Germany’s history, the country had one of the highest death rates for VV. It comes from a population of 49,000 in northeastern Germany.\nUnfortunately, the rate for number of people killed in coronavirus-related flu outbreaks is even higher, as it is related to an additional, less lethal virus that is commonly known as “mouth shot.”\nHIV was previously identified as the likely cause behind the deaths of 108 people (the number of people missing sickened in a recent case of HIV infection was 14) and 126 have died.\nOther confirmed cases of the virus, such as strains of celiac disease, also infect people with infections that can be a result of complications from IV drug treatments.\n“VV hits most people,” said Dr. Matthias Schweitzer, medical director of the Hernfeld-Tamlosft, a hospital for the People’s Health Authorities in Bad deutsch.\n“But such cases, from people with symptoms, are difficult to spread [the virus] to patients.”\nThat is because one is dead, another is still alive and few other health conditions such as sinus infections are found to have complications. That means that close to the rate of death is significantly lower than the rate for other countries.\n""The rate for deaths in other countries is all but identical to the death rate reported in Germany,"" Schweitzer said.\nThe biggest reason for the lowered death rate is an unrelated flu pandemic, as previously reported by The Local. Both the previous years in the region of Gürnener and Great Wolf took place in the same region. This was the first major pandemic in the region since World War II.\n""In addition, it appears that the introduction of this virus of respiratory disease has reduced the number of cases worldwide worldwide,"" Schweitzer said.\nThese new types of viruses affect an individual at a very small population rate. The deadliest particular viruses tend to penetrate bodily fluids rather than the bloodstream or the liver, making them more likely to spread to people that have nothing to do with viral causes.\nThe authors of the German government’s Emergency Department report say that there is one set of deaths in the different regions of Gürnener which were caused by flu infection but have not been considered because they are lesser advanced.\nThough the most recent data have not been issued yet, a collection of the infection rates from other countries indicates there is a lack of reliable information about how these people died from VV.\n""VV"" is an endemic virus found in the Nordic and Baltic countries, but is mainly regarded as a milder strain which more rapidly spread globally.\nThe press release received on April 1 from the Health Protection Agency (HPA) adds that the so-called “very aggressive” influenza pandemic was the first to hit the Nordic area and before that it was the second with unusual cases per capita and hospitalized patients, which led to the apprehension of healthcare staff.\n“By focusing on this extraordinarily difficult series of spread, the diagnosis and care of the new infection was not widely thought of and the drug development activity was not widely thought of,” the HPA said.\nMORE INFORMATION:\n• Europe-wide HIV infection rate is 10% less than the national average\n• Sweden has the highest death rate for the world in HIV transmission\n• Other countries with fewer cases reported by the HPA\n• Have had fewer deaths as a result of \'flu-related\' viruses?\n• Are there others who are more susceptible to the disease?\n• Who\'s at risk now?

444,Early-onset dementia in her middle-aged husband was uncurable — and almost unbearable.,"['Maggie Hoffmann is just a patient of her middle-aged husband John Dello Cruz. She’s diagnosed with dementia, a condition that causes her to wake up often late in the night and become sedated. Doctors have trouble getting the eyesight correct to see for periods and the nerves can slip off, leading to visual difficulties, she says.\n“Every day we leave the bathroom for a minute,” Hoffmann says, getting her head around. “It’s depressing. I couldn’t sleep.”\nHoffmann’s husband is preparing to retire from work and has suffered with Alzheimer’s disease, an affliction in which a second disease causes a change in the way we view and perceive the world. The 36-year-old earns about $350 a month, pays roughly $25 an hour, lives in Switzerland and makes about $32,000 a year. Hoffmann sees him as a sort of soul brother, taking care of him.\nBut life for them could get tough when their daughter learned about his diagnosis.\nIn early 2018, Maggie’s husband died, after years of struggle and long illness. She found out months later that his brain had shrunk, leaving her no time to take care of him.\n“When that happened, it was a time of massive amount of work that almost made me sad,” she said. “Life is full of life, and at some point it’s not just death, it’s fulfillment. I learned to really look at my own mortality, and even become more aware of the weight that I was carrying.”\nHoffmann moved to Italy from Oklahoma so she could be away on her current job at Sainte Scannie in Columbus, Ohio. She’s seen an increasing number of people come in to visit him, only to become convinced that he’s gone.\nBecause of his dementia, Hoffmann says, it’s harder for her to travel out of the state. “He was one of the closest friends of mine, and he was always helping me along with making me feel more at home,” she said.\nHer husband says he never thinks about losing his life, so when he goes to see her, he says something profound: “I love Maggie.”\n']"
445,Cancer patients are eager to use immunotherapy but sometimes chemotherapy is the far better option.,"['Thousands of cancer patients undergo chemotherapy and surgery every year, with around half of them returning in two years. But patients are increasingly keen to use their immunotherapy knowledge to treat diseases that need treatment before they progress – even if their treatment is tepid. However, many die from complications brought on by chemotherapy, such as backaches and bleeding and when a person learns to count by taking a test, experts are still very eager to see the effectiveness of combining immunotherapy and chemotherapy therapies. Dr Olumide Olujinmi, of the Natural Health Institute in Lagos, explains that chemotherapy, for example, is just one of many methods that can successfully treat an individual with advanced cancer. “Chronic lymphocytic leukemia can be a very effective treatment but in those cases, it can cause tragic death,” he says. “Given the nature of the disease, there is often that very difficult decision to make on how to treat the patient. That is where immunotherapy comes in.” There are two main types of chemotherapy that can be used. Oncogenic drugs like interferon and lenalidomide, which are large-scale forms of treatment, are commonly used, with their side effects often being severe and life-threatening. But switching on the therapy can be difficult as long as you put caution ahead of the decision. Eighty-two per cent of people with an aggressive type of cancer have to undergo chemo, and just seven per cent of the patients choose the treatment. That means chemotherapy is not the best option, with the conventional bioprasonical approach, often showing evidence of side effects and side effects in patients that are treated for years before needing treatment. The key is to ensure the cancer is quick and is, in theory, isolated and is not spread after treatment. When you use immunotherapy, however, patients are going to be more productive, they are more likely to have the best chance of avoiding hospitalisation, and they are less likely to die from complications that are brought on by the treatment. “Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has been a very difficult to treat disorder. It’s difficult to treat, there are complications and you sometimes need the life-saving treatment to be successful,” says Dr Olumide Olujinmi.\nTo get more information on immunotherapy and chemo from scientists, visit: www.cdc.gov.uk/goputro/agency/x-wh.\n']"

Beyond that, I think anybody can understand how UV filaments, which can bring back deadly heat, come off. I think heat is another major.”\nFor more than two decades, the American Medical Association has challenged the theory that hydrogen sulfide — a man-made chemical that alters the reaction process in the body’s plasma — has a limited role against avian and tree diseases, though no studies have come back even after more than 100 years.\n“Why hasn’t anybody looked into that?” said Larry Evans, the lead author of a top-secret study published last year. “We know that the most exciting in this book is UV filaments are a fossilised pancreas and may have been further treated with stuff. And can come from oils, in a natural form.”\nIn October, a major review paper appeared in the journal Science, and published in the journal Global Health claimed that water dripping to the surface of bacteria inside our bodies has also been linked to end-stage disease.\nBased on a stinging 1972 study, the International Institute for Climate and Environment said it had been investigating the potential carcinogenicity of some cleaning agents that are used on long-term antibiotics.\nBut a newly published study by Purdue University found that more than 400 compounds in 21 pharmaceutical-based medications were linked to some types of end-stage cancer. The studies used data gathered at more than four medical universities in the United States.\nThe impact could be huge. “There’s almost nothing that can be done to mitigate health effects caused by vapour pollution without taking some sort of good outcome,” said Michael Ogle, assistant professor of environmental health and geobiology at Purdue and lead author of the report.\nFor these reasons, experts urged caution on the integrity of the science behind predicting which pathogens might develop during a trip or near a site, particularly if a scientific team spot signs of sudden illness on the surface. “Science will require a lot of innovation to move forward,” Evans said.\nNearly every news story mentions being able to spot deadly disease on the surface of our skin. And for every hospitalized-attack someone developing a human papillomavirus, measles or mumps, there is a healthy assumption that something could be preventing them from coming into contact with that much air.\nIt is not clear if this is a bifurcation of risks.\n“We would need to evaluate whether it might increase susceptibility to a malignancy by saying things that either terrify or deactivate low-hanging flying objects, which have not been previously tested for,” said Brad Faraday, a professor of geriatrics at Purdue.\nLikewise, scientists are not experts on silica dust, which can be deposited on a billboard or in the wrong place, as the well-known University of Colorado of Colorado Boulder found.\nFor now, Evans hopes to test sodium monounsaturated and polyunsaturated oils with an energy-saver known as Hyperlipidogen, which has been linked to the star-sharing deaths of voodoo queens.\nHe and his colleagues wrote a 2003 paper saying they could pull off the trick if they found it.\n“This may be the cheapest way to do it,” said Evans. “The cells in the body, in some cases, have long been excreted by some sort of synthetic messenger from the surface of the sun. When sodium monounsaturated is acquired, some receptors are activated, like the blood tubes we associate with white blood cells.”\nEvans and his colleagues removed the water from blood tubes when they analyzed sodium monounsaturated and polyunsaturated oils and report that two-thirds of the sodium monounsaturated oils are reabsorbed by other liquids.\n___\nOn the Net:\n']"

This is due to more efficient use of air. Last week, Spain released its data about what is required from the air per metric tonne of air for health workers on the streets. This included: use of oxygen to control breathing, latencies, in addition to the ingestion of nutrients, metal particles and caesium.\nAlso in 2015, Spain’s air quality index averaged less than 10 per 100,000; this drop also corresponded to a rise in syphilis as well as HIV.\n']"

Housing is a part of our addiction to opioids, and we’re trying to figure out a way to close this gap.”\nUnder the agreement, hospitals and health centers that are funded or approved by the state park will be able to use buildings like Discovery Bay, because federal regulations state the park and its surrounding parks can’t be used outside.\nBut Slattery said this is different — “it’s not like a private medical center. You got to be there. You’re all in a sense,” he said.\nThus, there will be two reasons why hospitals can’t access Discovery Bay.\n“Hospitals with some equipment might not be as willing to use it,” he said.\nSubsidized rent is being paid on the hospital’s rooftop, and that’s the biggest obstacle to receiving that service. And a lot of times, a hospital that is only able to work for the tenants might be forced to pull out.\nSagetti said the future of public hospitals in the cities that qualify for the cooperative program is looking at another tenant when financing is more available.\n“You just haven’t seen, clearly, a real model in American hospitals of how that’s done,” he said.\nCITES A STATE PARK\nWhen: July 1, 14 and 15\nWhere: Founders Park, 2195 Denbigh Blvd.\nInformation: screowerpark.org/parks/sanecornia-state-park/index.html\n']"

The coroner’s office declined to disclose any additional details about which hospitals in the county had received the virus and to say whether infants were among those sickened.\n“This problem stems from the loss of earlier cases and particularly the rapid increase in cases reported in the 18 months between 2016 and 2018,” the spokesperson said. “The last time a common strain of high-potency high-risk high-risk high-risk bacteria, known as HCAV, was reported in a county’s jurisdiction was in Riverside County in 2016 and four of the five in California were in San Diego County.”\nThe agency said the outbreak of the unvaccinated form of the typhoid, which causes high fever, cough, and diarrhea, was recorded in five locations from San Diego County to Ontario in January.\nBecause it was suspected it was the single-type type, APO reports that the epidemic in San Diego has forced many insurance companies to ration coverage for certain types of infant health care in California. This has led to confusion among patients, as the CDC suggests that newborns are especially vulnerable to it.\nNot only will the county get its medications earlier this time and allow patients to stay healthy longer, but it also will also provide some insurance for older infants, when costs have tripled to $31,000 a year for the current system, the officials say.\n“The entire process of improving the system has its own challenges,” the Santa Clara County coroner’s spokesman said. “While some hospitals may have some assistance from the health and care providers, and some are covered by health insurance, other times, it may simply be uninsurable by others. We see that as an opportunity to reduce costs significantly and improve overall quality and quality.”\nAccording to the ACOM, 15 percent of newborns in the San Diego County area died in the past two years from virus infections.\n“There’s just a tremendous increase in cases in recent years but we still have the ‘foreign organism’ to keep up with. So now is the time to expand vaccination access to the community,” the spokesman said.\n-The Associated Press\n']"

They can also perform an important function in the episode of brain attacks called a natal nervous system, affecting the ability of a nervous system to stop itself from kicking the seat.\nTwo of the patients developed cerebral palsy because of a condition called posterior monocroma dystrophy.\nDr. Aaron Kanefsky, an optometrist at Saint Luke’s, told Gusoff that his patients generally have some level of disability.\n“Neural stress is a stress hormone. You have balance in certain muscles and then you have a linear difference in that,” Kanefsky said. “When we prescribe to people, we leave them just that.”\nEach patient’s walk is monitored by Dr. Kanefsky, who believes many are unaware of their condition.\n“They don’t realize that they’re playing around with this, that this is possible,” he said.\nKanefsky said the devices will not only help diabetes patients keep on their medications but also help one end-of-life patients stay healthy.\n“A lot of people are not aware of the importance of self-management, and so they stick to their drug regimen. As the patient gets older, those are the most important things in terms of preventing complications,” he said.\n']"

It has suffered infections in patients as little as a few months old and these infections are not only life threatening but also largely preventable in terms of the best antiviral drugs they could, etc. In terms of treating those who are affected, however, antiviral drugs can usually be prescribed within five days.\nThe life-threatening virus has also been well researched and taken very far away from viruses. Symptoms include bloating, muscle aches, the inability to move, coughing, loss of vision and staggering tiredness.\nRecently, a natural host of virus infections in newborn children have been detected as young as 6 months. This virus is found by someone’s inner ear and is understood to reactivate when the host of the virus attacks it. To the contrary, this is not discovered until a child’s final urine test is recorded.\nIt is known that although an increased fever and tiredness is considered to be an symptom of V. stomach virus, the most common symptoms are headaches, dizziness, nausea, headache, rapid breathing, convulsions, sweating, and vomiting.\nV. stomach virus is a lot more contagious than just one fly fly virus. It has its own number of protrusions, viruses, variants, causes, most importantly cause, the deaths of children with no underlying health problems. More recently, a Brazilian woman with microchips had possibly been infected with the virus. She was taken to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for testing.

453,Firms rush to make at-home tests for coronavirus,"['OAKLAND, Calif. — California Health officials believe coronavirus patients who became infected with the bird flu virus in the past year can safely be screened for the pneumonia virus before they recover.\nInfected patients already eligible for routine flu vaccinations will face a wait as the state works to comply with the newly introduced requirements, said Larry Nevin, state director of public health.\nHis announcement comes a week after the California Health Department updated its infection prevention rules that may raise suspicion about whether the disease is such a bad deal for carriers and whether those infected will spend time in the hospital before they recover.\nHe said the expanded criteria Thursday came from the new control group made up of scientists who classify influenza cases at 12 surgical centers and at one hospital each year. Officials have said it\'s too early to call definitively whether coronavirus infections have set off the flu epidemic.\nThe virus has caused some 11,600 cases since the virus first was detected three years ago, though it\'s unclear why the number is low. The extent of its spread has been numerous, raising concerns about the welfare of citizens who may not yet have been hospitalized.\nThe state has released about $105 million for the report of the adjuvanted virus at 11 different care centers, which is expected to raise doubts about how well the immune system protects people against the worst flu ever, Nevin said.\nThe vaccine is typically used to fight infections elsewhere, such as in Japan.\n""In an already challenging situation, the vaccine\'s current use is so minimal that many carriers cannot be vaccinated until their hearts and immune systems are in great shape,"" said Richard Johnson, a professor of flu medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles, referring to patients whose viral history is already at risk.\nEven so, officials are relying on work by the Public Health Agency of California, which has invested millions of dollars in the vaccines that were produced a decade ago. They\'ve found that the protective shots are ineffective in requiring more time in the hospital.\nIn March, it was announced that testing and vaccination of flu-carrying passengers would begin at 32 hospitals around the state. They will check the behavior of the passengers, monitor reaction to tests and hold medical appointments. And this year, departments in California to help with the count will select new components of the vaccine.\nHospitals are still operating on schedule to close all these centers by next month. All at-home testing will be done on patient-by-patient basis, officials said, ahead of seasonal flu vaccine drop-offs.\nDonna Williams of Oakland said she fears that she\'ll soon be overstating the number of infections.\n""It\'s really scary to see the number of deaths so soon,"" she said.\nBut at the local news conference announcing Thursday\'s diagnosis, Dr. Christopher Bonney, director of the county\'s Center for Infectious Disease Research, said the numbers had ""taken a fresh turn.""\nNevin said the new virus is not the end of the world, and the state is prepared for any outbreak. Though a daily average of 2,800 cases of swine flu is expected for the season, he said additional confirmed cases are possible in less than two months.\n""That means something would be significant,"" he said.\nThe new measures will help health care workers detect the virus to prevent the spread of it, said Bonney, who also oversaw the revised guidelines. The changes, which are due in August, would go into effect Oct. 15.\nCounty emergency response officials posted updates on social media about how the new protocols had been used at a San Francisco hospital — including links to websites that promote vaccine-biting. Such websites could have links to the four California hospitals involved.\nAmong other things, the state database will include the type of test to identify vaccination should the virus pass within 24 hours and other information on hospital climate and fire conditions. In other words, the vaccine label should include the polio virus vaccine that causes the Ebola virus. The statewide vaccine database will also include behavior statistics and measures of hospital temperature.\nNevin said the county was completely backing the current standards, which said all too soon that ""total infection"" testing would begin without prior authorization. He predicted that possible data this year would lead to privacy and safety concerns.\nThe new guidelines will ""allow for all of our people to see and hear about influenza status in a quick, well-controlled manner,"" he said.\n']"
454,Blood from people who recover from coronavirus could provide a treatment,"['CHICAGO (AP) — A groundbreaking new heart technology could help overcome a rare genetic illness that has shaken an entire industry of hospitals, doctors and even patients.\nThe new heart broke the legs of a woman who had a heart attack as a newborn baby. The infant was treated at a U.S. hospital and delivered only 20 minutes later, one of the earliest signs of the fatal coronavirus.\nThe highest-profile chikungunya outbreak in decades, sparked by a rare cluster of severe cases in Asia, was confirmed in January. That announcement prompted the nation’s largest insurer to head off action from the American Society of Hematology and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.\nLouis DiBardocca, director of the group’s hospital program, said that as the most likely pathogen in an otherwise healthy population, the virus is a tiny component of every 4.5 percent of blood from approximately 4,000 newborns. The diagnosis should help prevent other complications such as heart attack and other heart rhythm disorders.\nThe institute was one of several groups looking to combat the silent killer that still kills half a million people each year in the U.S. and adds tens of thousands to a national waiting list, Deirdre Rudich, the institute’s chief scientific officer, said in an interview.\nWith that financing coming on stream, DiBardocca said he had a vision: Health care providers could get back to treating patients as if they were alive and not surviving.\nA Heart Therapeutic Center in Ewing, Indiana, is working with Eckart Milbank, a family practice manager, and Yervoy Medical Center in Wisconsin on developing a blood test. The test, which could detect more common types of AIDS in the chikungunya, used sophisticated technology, DiBardocca said.\nIn its first patient, 80 percent of patients have the virus, but deaths from it have been reduced among those who had no symptoms. Most deaths are women who haven’t had the virus when they were babies.\n“We think it’s the smartest thing to do,” DiBardocca said.\nBut the causes of the disease have changed, “for better or worse.” The prevalence of chikungunya has dropped to 7.3 percent among pregnant women, 22 percent among children 18 to 30 years old and 39 percent among veterans of the U.S. military, where the virus is most prevalent, DiBardocca said.\nWith the rate cut, however, chikungunya survivors now more likely to die than parents — because of the knowledge — said Judith Waldron, senior vice president for nursing, at Chicago Hospital’s Center for Quality at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.\n“It’s a very rare disease,” Waldron said.\nMost people who develop a heart attack die within four months, while heart disease patients who survive three to eight years gain two to five years. The delay can last much longer, with initial symptoms occurring on or around the age of 30. About 20 percent of patients with a heart attack die within eight years.\nDoctors who treat these individuals often spot a fever, headache, weakness or appetite, and respond immediately. With the new heart-spectar technology, they can target two travelers — all mammals and most individuals — after the chikungunya infection, letting patients know they’re sick.\n“If you go from normal to morbidly obese, you’re already as sick as a baby or a man,” DiBardocca said.\n']"
455,"Despite Trump’s claims, the U.S. is far behind in coronavirus testing","['× Despite Trump’s claims, the U.S. is far behind in coronavirus testing\nThe U.S. has found it less than a year since the tragic discovery of chills across a pig’s anus.\nExperts at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases warned Thursday that despite a series of interventions, complacency and a tight implementation schedule may be complicating the progress the country has made in surveillance and testing vaccines that address most of the challenges associated with chills.\nThe American Association of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Food and Drug Administration are all trying to better understand potential risks associated with chills.\nIn a report released Thursday, the American Academy of Pediatrics is recommending that institutions that administer vaccines to young people should do so as well.\nThe new report states, “Panda fever and other outbreaks in two countries - India and China - continue to pose a significant threat to health for young infants and young adults.”\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Food and Drug Administration are all trying to better understand potential risks associated with chills. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Food and Drug Administration are all trying to better understand potential risks associated with chills. SEE MORE VIDEOS\nThis week, the Department of Health and Human Services published a report that said more than 40 million Americans have been infected with chills — the fourth-most of any international source of disease — and there are more than four million cases worldwide annually.\nIn late January, the Food and Drug Administration published a report describing a rapidly rising number of countries in which there is a risk of chills for many infants, like India and China.\nU.S. laboratory results from the latest testing program are vital to the agency’s quest to keep records from vaccines that harm children and at the same time safeguard their health, said Michael and Ellen Loomis, the research scientists on the center’s B-Bot program.\n“Once a sample goes in, it’s up to a third of the country’s people to sign up,” Michael Loomis said.\nThe website for the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases says that 6 percent of the world’s 3.1 million cases of Chills are identified as chills, although researchers are not yet satisfied with the agency’s test results.\nA careful review of previous clinical trials using 14 million chills in 17 countries found that some vaccines, and those that were effective in preventing serious underlying causes of chills, did not meet the goal of prevention.\nThe report offers no suggestion that the government is insensitive to possible risks of chills. However, it is clear that vaccines are a reliable long-term source of healthy children.\nThe government’s computerized database is another example of what the ACAP refers to as a “digital head-to-head” approach. In the wake of last fall’s “Monkeypox” pandemic, caregivers and analysts from the National Center for Health Statistics stepped in to help track down chills from the deaths of 7.5 million children across the globe.\nThe ACAP report identifies several pathways in which the vaccine response would take place if too few of those vaccinated had been vaccinated. They include strong protection against viruses and people infected by another infectious disease such as Ebola.\nHowever, that is highly unlikely for Chills. A high probability of human chills for much of the world, including North America, makes the vaccine against Ebola susceptible for some infectious diseases, said Dr. Elizabeth Cappo, an associate professor of vaccines at the Bancroft School of Medicine at Northwestern University.\nCappo, who is a manager of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases’ immunization program, said about half of the countries in which chills occur lack high-level vaccinations, such as Malaysia, China and India.\nIn the United States, just under 24 percent of sickle cell anemia vaccines were passed out in 2015, the report said.\n“A large component of chills occur in regions that need to be disrupted by more effective vaccines,” she said.\n']"
456,Hospitals consider universal do-not-resuscitate orders for coronavirus patients,"['The situation risks being mirrored by non-hospital stakeholders and could trigger changes in the way hospitals investigate and monitor patients after a coronavirus outbreak in Quebec has continued to spread.\nThe system for accessing death certificates for the entire community had not been devised during this outbreak, but the hospital in Passmere, Que., is weighing the options with new procedures and plans to evaluate the criteria for the process.\nThe Director of Service and Nursing, Jean-Paul Brault, will now make an assessment at a consultative meeting with family and friends in advance of a much-anticipated meeting with Quebec health authorities next month, after a wide-ranging inquiry into the outbreak.\nBrault was directly involved in efforts to track down the infection before it spread to Moncton in Moncton.\nHarvey Northrup, executive director of CareMedia, the regional media company based in Edmonton, said the company has found it difficult to track down patient data relevant to the case.\nThe initial theory that the coronavirus was spread deliberately is “incredible” but still amounts to “nearly one in every 10” cases, he said.\n“Any solution that goes beyond personal data and considers its own vulnerability for potentially viral infections is a disaster,” Northrup said.\nSymptoms of coronavirus infection should be seen immediately, but there is risk of dehydration and pneumonia (a potentially fatal virus), and inhalation when diarrhea rolls down a body, he said.\nThe problem is that patients such as the man who died in two Quebec hospitals, a man who died of a common preventable illness, have been resistant to antibiotics in the past.\n“So if we are really looking at human survival rate, what can be seen as reliable history is different for some patients,” said Northrup.\nAn analysis from the Ontario-based Hospital Association showed that in the five Moncton clusters (Gröhrig, Nanaimo, Shillington, Plaisance and Mendell), six deaths, 69 patients remained undiagnosed.\nIts analysis was done in more than 100 hospitals across North America. The findings won praise from Quebec patients and have led to urgent legislation being put in place to allow hospitals to order confirmed cases into the community.\nBrault is recommending that patients with chronic illnesses – such as asthma, breast cancer, diabetes or HIV – be labelled as vulnerable.\nUntil now, those with acute respiratory infections were considered trapped at risk, or too sick to take a test.\nMore than one-third of those having advanced signs of respiratory infection could be re-quoted and diagnosed as early, but many would ultimately die before they could be recalled, Brault said.\n“That’s a real priority …” Brault said.\n']"

Kelly Ayotte was one of the four senators who opposed the House Intelligence Committee plan to repeal the ban.\nAyotte said the issue — Iran sanctions — still has not been addressed by Congress. She said her mind must be on how to influence the lifting of sanctions, and if any sort of resolution is “necessary” and not something Iran might do that would spark international retaliation.\nAyotte and Sen.

Susan Collins to give their feedback on the bill and advised Republicans to “move on” from their actions.\n“‘We need to be crystal clear on what our legislation is and to move on,’” McClellan wrote in the letter. “Hopefully this will give some momentum to those who continue to obstruct legislation.”\nSen. John McCain is set to appear Wednesday before a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing examining what McCain has said he’s done in doing his re-election push to reverse Donald Trump’s military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan.

However, Republican Sen. Susan Collins has said she will likely do so as well. Collins has said no decision on whether to put sanctions on the United States has been made.\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders earlier on Monday announced that the administration will deploy staff to several Middle East locations — including Saudi Arabia — as part of a more aggressive strategy against Iran.\nSanders said the administration would work with Congress and the American people “to reach a common understanding with our allies,” and “to encourage a growing consensus to include an even broader debate on a nuclear deal between Iran and the world.”\nOther nations at risk of imposing sanctions on include the European Union, Turkey, Qatar, and Bahrain.\n']"
458,"Andrew Cuomo during the covid-19 crisis is the same as ever, with one big difference: People like him","['Andrew Cuomo was an unpleasant, bombastic Mayor of New York in the height of the public ire known as “The Revolution”, coiled in pique among his own partisans, with the same insults, hyperbole and critique expressed by far too many people (that is, not just New Yorkers). Governor Cuomo used his time as a candidate, and as a Senate candidate, to be as unwelcome as any other ever. This crisis, at one point, lasted for 1.5 million days, and it began over so many years in 2015 in the United States itself, with the inevitable errors of omission, forgetfulness, and outrage. Cuomo isn’t a bad person on Tuesday’s extraordinary VP convention when it comes to foreign relations. It’s exactly the kind of dilemma the POTUS has faced that matters to him.\nWhile perhaps not a particularly weak card, Cuomo’s “Politics of Avoidance” over the years has largely consisted of aggressive, sometimes heavy-handed behavior: on Tuesday he scolded Donald Trump at the International Chamber of Commerce while Republican President Obama enjoined it “to be more transparent and fair”, suggesting he is way out of line. (His demeanour, which has transformed his White House tenure and caused a serious and damaging political tension with the Republican White House, was perhaps most notable in the Trumpian ire, because Cuomo, perhaps best described as a “fine-tuned director”, had a close personal relationship with Trump during the election campaign.) And with which, however bizarre, he is close to Trump, how could this year’s Democratic nominee bring back abuse and intimidation?\nA lot has happened since 2014, but now it is time to get focused on what the remainder of 2020 will do, and what the fallout to Comeback Strategies and their business partners and allies will do in the not-too-distant future. Cuomo’s ejection from Trump would have been a death knell for 2020 entirely, and one way to send some weight back into New York’s intelligence community and state’s office next year is for Cuomo to unequivocally deny he was involved in that incident.\nThis will not be his first sentence, and it will not be the last.\nThen again, it’s a very dark work, and New York has just past been taken to its darkest hour. Even if Cuomo were to return for his duties after this New Year’s vacation, his credibility is not on the line, and he will not be able to earn any credit for it in his own lives — in this case, his own life and his own performance at the turn of the century. Just as important, with questions raised about his citizenship and religion, Cuomo’s return will be likely to result in a divisive outcome.\nUntil he looks for something else to gain him the unfettered release that would be necessary to make a speech in support of his presidency in the 2018 elections and dedicate his life to public service, it is unclear that he will do well in the 2020 race.\nWashington Post blogger Robin Knight has been working on a “Voice of Democracy” series at Blogspot.\n']"

They predict there will be up to 50 cases of death and up to a peak of one death each week.\nEmerging evidence suggests that we are in for an ‘urgent’ outbreak as the continuing continuation of the outbreaks in the US appears to have driven a surge in numbers.\nThat is reflected in an increase in the number of recently identified individuals (or ‘courageous’ individuals) linked to the outbreak, leading to a spike in the number of potential coronavirus cases. The CDC advises that these could be suspicious individuals who likely mistook ‘greedy’ family members for people with a serious case of the infection.\nIn the UK, various types of coronavirus emerge during pregnancy and some form of mastitis associated with older parents.\nPrevious outbreaks have been suspected to be related to humans with abnormalities in or increased intrauterine growth and sex. It is thought that the death rate of newly diagnosed cases is substantially higher than that seen in the general population.\nThese particular cases have been caused by additional vaccine-preventable products (SVPs) that have been introduced in the UK in response to a rapid increase in the number of bacterial cases reported in children. SVPs are now being linked to a number of presumed common problems such as polio, measles, kangarooiosis and seasonal autism.\nOf course the best clinical trial for controlling the outbreak has not yet been found, but are looking to see how scientists and healthcare workers can manage the outbreak.\nOnce-healthy people who acquire Ebola and Merck vaccine-preventable infections are at significantly greater risk for subsequent cases, possibly due to vaccination of older adults.\nA recent study examined the effectiveness of anti-viral drugs against porcine distemper virus and there have been numerous articles of advice about how to prevent these diseases. However, despite the best efforts of numerous clinical trials to find ways to prevent and treat this new outbreak, the popular usage of anti-viral drugs only increased the likelihood of infection with the virus.\nWe have a responsibility to ensure that all measures are in place to manage the spread of this outbreak, which may begin to lead to the epidemic itself. Thus, the groups that have been involved in the past have strengthened the efforts to control the outbreak at the community level and at the national level, but continue to back away from the obvious conclusion that the full force of the disease will be needed to bring the virus to an end.\nSince the fourth outbreak of coronavirus identified last year, the spread of the disease has experienced a meteoric rise in popularity in the US and abroad. Globally, the vaccine is among the most widely used treatments and the drug could be one of the most efficacious interventions.\nHowever, as the number of cases of exposure to coronavirus decreases over time, it may be a matter of national security which we must be careful to prevent. The USA has an obligation to ensure that local children and pregnant women receive proper vaccinations. These measures will provide the utmost protection from infection and from distemper disease which can be transmitted from head to toe, and are therefore high risk.\nIn the same way as UNFPA has come under fire for creating a condom backlog that is costing hundreds of millions of dollars, at the moment, legislation has been drafted so that parents can order an unregulated product with transparency and adequate protection against vaccine or distemper illness, such as micro-nutrient-sensitive condoms.\nThis is not to say that these are the only and tertiary commitments we need to make, however. It is important to acknowledge the much more important role we can play to reduce the spread of dengue, chikungunya and pneumococcal diseases.\nHowever, all of these infections are extremely common and one of the major concerns is that they are extremely common in these conditions and can lead to serious deaths.\nDr. Richard Armstrong-Sheng is a clinician and epidemiologist based at the Prudential Centre for Allergy, Immunology and Clinical Immunology in Potsdam, Germany.

They also raise unanswerable questions.,"['(Kit Reiss/CNET) -- The usefulness of DNA tests is as important as the benefit they provide or the question, ""What can I tell that makes me really strong?""\nMedical scientists say there are far greater opportunities for questioning why people develop certain cancers -- for example, when and how they are affected.\nIs this knowledge really necessary to treat cancers that otherwise might be treated with traditional treatments, including drugs or radiation? Or is this the very real power of home DNA testing?\nHome DNA testing centers use kit kits to request and collect data on thousands of eligible patients from four different states in one day, but could that same system run into trouble if it were to fail on one occasion?\nOn Thursday, reports by the Washington Post reveal that the precise function of the skin by test tubes for false negative results has been a persistent and growing source of controversy.\nAnother worry, in particular, is the contamination of patient data: the report said breast cancer treatments used for negative results tend to use root cells and fish DNA, for example.\nCannone cells consist of DNA, which forms a bed of chemical atoms. Other animals rely on it for their environment and cleaning.\n""But because you can only see certain parts of the lymph nodes or the outer shell of a lung, it doesn\'t make sense to use these cells specifically to get false positive results,"" says David Shafner, co-director of the Center for Biotechnology and Science at UC Davis in Davis, Calif.\nThe spread of cancer cells spreads at a faster rate than a human immune system can handle, and this can have ripple effects that affect each other.\n""They can disrupt the antimicrobial activity and/or break up bacteria, alter the drug and/or vaccine chemistry, and cause chemical reactions,"" Shafner says.\nThe federal government reported to Congress last month that its College of Arts and Sciences Department has at least 80 different labs now sampling samples of DNA.\n""This can\'t be attempted in all precincts,"" Shafner said.

466,Some countries use temperature checks for coronavirus. Others don’t bother. Here’s why.,"['Share:\nLOS ANGELES - Some countries use temperature checks for coronavirus (a “signature” virus that is set to develop to be an early warning system) or specific influenza B virus. And some countries don’t bother. Some countries don’t even bother, as data available from the UN comings-and-goings shows. Yet some signatories to the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, serve as regulators for all the member-states of the planet’s largest climate change conferences.\nThese countries take steps in advance to get a ready-made system in place. Count them as signatories. But some of them don’t bother.\nAmong the other signatories for the Scientific Advisory Committee for Biological Diversity report on a recent meeting in Zurich was Thailand, the sole signatory. The island nation’s congress is held every three years, while its institute, the Centre for the Study of International Climate at Oxford University, uses the international climate talks to make some changes to its economy. In the March meeting in Switzerland, Thailand’s Congress put a label on every member state to meet state-by-state greenhouse gas-related targets. That is, it makes sure all member states are on the same page, without making any ill-effects on the climate.\nGood things come to those who wait.\nEarlier this year, the United States launched a national plan for climate change adaptation, or COP21, to take effect in 2021. It proposed using paper CO2 emissions data to calculate average average CO2-carbon emissions over 20 years from 2040-90. Each state would be charged with its own weather, and information in the “climate change readiness assessment,” which mirrors the climate talks, is shared by national climate scientists. The U.S. Department of the Interior in Washington, meanwhile, oversees assessments of climate risks. The aim is to redraw those predictions more easily.\nProbably the biggest challenge for developing countries is going to be reducing the use of fossil fuels. Almost 100 million U.S. households are due to be connected to gas-related electricity by 2020, under plans submitted last year by the country’s Department of Energy and the U.S. Agency for International Development. This new information should come at a time when some countries are already cutting energy-to-heat ratios in response to the projected rise in temperatures. Meanwhile, burning coal, oil and natural gas is threatening to slow emissions.\nSome nations, like Indonesia, have laid the groundwork for a technology that will keep carbon emissions down to pre-industrial levels by 2050. Indonesia will also use CO2-based research to get the right technologies to make its own targets. A review of 2014 studies of this technology’s efficacy in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions will be released soon.\nBut there is a big difference between making a plan to make good on every promise and staying ahead of the curve. More is often expected of nations. The more detail that comes out, the bigger the gap gets.\nEnter Kiribati, an island nation which aims to reduce annual emissions by 12 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030. Kiribati also has a sizable population of thousands of people who depend on fishing and building up their crops, and a slew of agricultural projects that analysts say will bolster its agriculture industry. It’s different from the Philippines, another development country, which is aiming to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by a similar amount to 2005 levels by 2050. And it’s not just India that has succeeded in the past decade.\nYet some things are less important, such as setting firm targets for coal-fired power generation and diversifying from oil- and gas-related assets. In contrast, the United States has lifted its global carbon-cutting target even though it is adopting unconventional fossil fuels, in areas that might very well be climate ready. (For more on fossil fuels, check out The Post’s Global Carbon Project.)\nThe question is whether the world will stop kicking all the slow-moving and litigious helllocks around that country and turn the temperature of the planet, which is expected to rise above 20C by 2100, into a future that is “reliable” to bear on existing plants and animals.\n']"

468,Trump is breaking every rule in the CDC’s 450-page playbook for health crisis,"[""A massive public health scandal erupted last November after Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price shut down a secret Department of Health and Human Services list of junk products that the CDC tested. This practice has become a growing issue in America, not only because of the failures in the disease center over the past decade and a half, but also because of the way health care care - including Medicaid, which supplies healthcare to fewer than 3 million poor children and young adults - has been destroyed by this personal agenda.\nThe CDC’s quest to control our healthcare system has led to the unprecedented expansion of Ebola prevention and care for sick and sicker people.\n“The CDC requires every aspect of health care management to include critical screening for infectious diseases, early diagnosis, high-risk preventive care and testing. But that strategy has been discredited, not only by the shameful approach of Price, but by the uncoordinated training and ineffective use of costly, non-specific reference languages.” [ACCL]\nFrom “The CDC’s Invasion of the Official Food Guide” to the explosion of Trump Syndrome and a rampant, “career takeover of the CDC,” there is no convincing explanation for this congressional obsession with all things health:\n“It has been a decade since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration began taking steps to prepare for high-risk diseases in a manner consistent with the CDC’s rationales.” [POT]\nAnd the next-generation AP’s smart reporting this week proves we need the CDC and its bad guys in the Department of Health and Human Services to serve the health needs of our young people.\nThe big picture is plain to see that the CDC, the “Healthcare Working Group,” the NIH and the HHS ought to be cutting their bloated budget by 40 percent over the next decade – because they care for sick young people.\nThere is certainly a reason why the “Idea Cuts for Government Interference” has been described as the “No Appointments Better Math” election. Because Secretary Price and his staffers did nothing to stop the Bush-era program that “continued to allow businesses to avoid using public funds to conduct health services in the U.S.” And because they did nothing to help “emergencies.” [ACCL]\nRather than addressing costs, the authors were instead asking us to look up the HHS threat to the medical services of “developmentally ill” children. [Click the ellipsis]\nThe early-state arm of a US government agency in critical need of customer care was appropriately replaced by a delivery office for Medicaid. This operation is a black hole for the Department of Health and Human Services at the moment. How many elderly patients are left in this state of undignified neglect? That’s why there’s an ad hoc effort to place Trump on a one-term FCC authority.\nBut they're explaining. They’re under the gun for 24-year-old Betsy DeVos who’s negotiating to join the NRA and wants to sign on with Nancy Pelosi to unseat Warren G. Harding.\n“The CDC,” Vox’s Andrew Daly added, “tried to subvert state health insurance subsidies because they believe they could justify higher costs by providing financial incentives, such as rebates and tax credits, to Medicaid recipients or disabled children, and by offering an ‘unbundled funding system’ called the ‘public-private partnership’ that would incentivize cities and states to implement local-based health care choices.” [Click the ellipsis]\nAs Bloomberg News pointed out this week, the CDC is under unprecedented pressure not to fill facilities for the sick and poor, because this process cuts costs and slows down diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases. But the charts don’t lie and in some cases the results are now known.\nIt’s a disheartening example of all of the hucksters, self-proclaimed experts and accountants who hide behind a culture of special interest selling. This phony steward of the latest media lies and creates a competitive environment for those who are bleeding the practice from the top.\nNo wonder the CDC is spending so much time and energy trying to warn the rest of us of an over-diagnosis of our chronic diseases.\n""]"

470,Coronavirus: Reopening the US by Easter 'a beautiful timeline',"['This story was updated at 11:22 a.m. with a comment from a National Centers for Disease Control official.\nThe catastrophic U.S. outbreak of E. coli and salmonella has begun over Easter, local health officials said Monday, a timeline on the disease’s history and the potential toll to the public.\nE. coli and salmonella have been a global concern for more than a decade.\nBoth illnesses remain common in people but generally don’t cause any serious illness.\nThe 11th annual pilgrimage of the U.S. people of goodwill, coming from East Asia, South America and Europe, from 400 countries in some recent weeks, has been the busiest since the outbreak in 2014. As of Sunday, its toll had already risen to 800. That’s what health officials had previously told you about E. coli infections in people caught on video; they stopped counting after seeing that they appeared to be harmless.\nThe virus is transmitted through the feces of contaminated people and is more common in people 10-15 years old.\nAnd even as the outbreak dwindles, people haven’t stopped paying attention to the daily news.\nE. coli is considered to be infected only by eating the aflatoxin pellets in the blood of someone who has severe stomach-altering bacteria.\nWhile it’s difficult to determine how many people have also been infected, they “are in some place in the winter, they’re in the summer, (and) they’re not all that sick,” said Dr. Claire Lucas, the hospital director in Grande Prairie, Canada.\nE. coli has already been linked to four deaths in the past two weeks, including one in Quebec. That’s said to be the “continued threat” of potentially deadly pneumonia in people who have had extreme diarrhea in the past, said Dr. Deborah Businski, who has treated hospitalized cases of E. coli.\nBetween 2002 and 2013, there were 17 E. coli outbreaks in the U.S., including 37 deaths, according to the CDC. Most often they occurred on Easter and Christmas, but as of Saturday, 17-21 of those patients were infected, according to CDC director Tom Frieden.\nThere were 63 people infected in the U.S. last year, including five who received new infections, according to CDC figures. Many of those hospitals saw a spike in cases as people stopped coming back for antibiotics, eating contaminated meat or drinking contaminated water.\nOf those 18 in the emergency room, four or more were infected with E. coli and more than 100 were hospitalized.\nWidespread transport of contaminated or contaminated food or drink even to people who have been ill may have led to illnesses in the five cases. But even if people didn’t have infections, people in the unvaccinated are vulnerable to the best way to avoid getting sick, from eating contaminated food or drinking contaminated water or drinking contaminated water.\n“If there are no significant hospitalizations, you want the person who is in the middle of getting the most fever or who has diarrheal illness to be the main source,” said Businski. “It’s more resilient if there’s some kind of collection by the hospital or the hospital.”\nE. coli infection includes diarrhea in soiled clothing, sweating, vomiting, and gastrointestinal problems, and gastrointestinal illnesses usually range from moderate to severe.\nSome people can infect others, for instance by touching contaminated surfaces or eating contaminated foods. But nearly all adults, even the most severe, should get antibiotics once they’ve been sick.\nThe virus remains prevalent in the U.S., with outbreaks occurring in 16 states and four territories in 17 days.\nAlthough there have been outbreaks before, Tuesday’s visitors will get a taste of what’s to come.\nUS officials plan to hold the annual pilgrimage for family, friends and neighbors in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Click here to read more about the event.\nMore than a week ago, a child was hospitalized with diarrhea in a Bancroft County hospital after being swallowed from a food cart.\nSo far, the number of cases of E. coli outbreaks has totaled 2,400.\nOnce the outbreak is over, four children in Grand Rapids have been sickened — five kids, including their mother.\nNearly 1,000 people infected with illnesses linked to E. coli infections around the world have been hospitalized in northern Italy. Five people have died and more than 500 have been hospitalized.\nDo you live in Grand Rapids? Share your news with us in the comments section.\n']"

And I, of course, that is what our judges are going to do and that is what our attorneys are going to do,” he said.\nOther differences between the Trump family, including the legal costs, should be worked out.\n“I really hope that something can be done over the course of that period, especially from my side of the aisle, where they can get their foundation together in some semblance of peace,” Trump said.\nIn the end, the legal fees he said would not apply would “couple up the fact that the divorce is going to be like it was,” he said.\n“And I believe the law is going to handle it in a very appropriate way,” he said.\n(This version of the story removes extraneous word “trust”, a factor in rewriting headline)\n']"

''From conversations we had about security in school we got real vague conversations about safety. These are just regular safety measures now we're doing.''\nChicago faces a threat of a major cyberattack that could damage an already emptying gym class, for instance. The latest with maximum exposure is University Park's Purple Mall, which will also be available for workout-related services for students.\nMore than 25,000 people are expected to travel through the downtown area Monday after a Virginia Tech gunman entered the campus Friday night, leaving 20 dead and more than 150 wounded.\nIn late February, two of Baltimore's famous Prineville High School classes reopened Monday after reinstating for the first time in years.\nAs the height of a summer playground crunch, some employees at Maryland Shores Elementary School warned students that a similar home-opening situation had hit them too close to campus. Some classrooms, though, saw staff with portable computers in class.\nThere was concern Monday as students walked out, and day-to-day at city schools were downgraded to the district's core. But school officials and school board members played down fears of increased security.\nSome educators worried they could still be at risk for exposure to the disease. Jesse Wang, the president of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Saturday's move signals that schools may not be immune.\n''If it's a controlled test that shows uncoordinated responses that a normal environment is not showing, especially in elementary school, what's that?\n''We're not immune, we're not safe,'' he added.\nThe mayor has said he is considering a number of possible measures to prevent the contagious virus at school in the coming weeks.\nAll elementary school buildings should be at maximum capacity and have personal phones and laptops, teachers in area classrooms may use specially trained counselors to keep students away from computers, and pupils in certified health-care centers will have access to other facilities.\n''At 8:30 a.m. a social security number may be stolen by someone else so as to cause trouble,'' Emanuel said.\n''And who knows how many children might die from this virus, and who is in charge of that,'' he added.\nThe city's health-care centers are among the first that will offer no-closing facilities.\nThe Killarney College Prep program will be opening at 7 p.m. Wednesday. Authorities are focusing on pregnant women as a possible risk and are considering evacuating the rape investigation unit as well.\n''The administration will examine additional security measures and educate our students about the consequences,'' said Bobell Piernic, spokesman for the district's Office of Emergency Management.\n''We have to just know the approach that is taken'' and can adopt a school safety plan, Piernic said.\nOn Friday, police were handling an unusual rush of gunfire and spot-checks. Another officer was hurt when he was struck by a gunshot while responding to a house fire Wednesday. But two rounds reportedly were fired after the gunfire. The chief of the department's public-safety unit said he was expected to be fine.\nOfficials will meet with reporters before departing the National Institutes of Health for the summer.\nWang said that even if the focus shifts back to combatting the virus, the city's high school enrollment must remain accessible. He explained that middle school students in Baltimore school districts will be students living elsewhere, away from schools.\nIn addition to at least 12 Madison Avenue elementary schools, the city's next school will go online at Brooklyn Public Schools.\nOrganizers of the 2014 Crossroads Youth Festival said it will be a ''scoping exercise'' to examine security measures.\n""]"

478,Do I have coronavirus? What are the symptoms?,"['Share\nThe Dunhuber coronavirus (whoever happened to be a) has been named with the sole purpose of preventing any influenza outbreak in Germany.\nPneumonia is a painful inflammation of the membranes that hold the heart and lungs, covering most of the body, which is why parents of swine influenza burden are advised to wait a minute before starting routine check-ups for pneumonia.\nFor the future, it seems that diagnosis is the key to the cure of any illness. Symptoms can include depression, inactivity, fever, headache, muscle aches, difficulty swallowing, lethargy, numbness, with blurry vision, broken jaw, and the inability to swallow or swallow well in low temperatures – though this is treated with antibiotics. If a patient is hospitalized, taking a drug of any substance called immunoglobulin A (Uggau), prolongs the duration of symptoms.\nWetness has been among the most common causes of H1N1 influenza, and sufferers receive the fever and headache often within about 48 hours of infection. This has made it harder for patients to recuperate to prevent the spread of infection, with 16 percent of all new cases taking place within three days of infection, the overwhelming majority occurring within two days of infection.\nAfter lung inflammation, the most commonly severe symptoms can include severe headache, along with feeling unwell, moody and constricted. Normally, the heart needs to be considered as a possible cause of infection by a first glance of the symptoms. But this rule change is a potential indicator to test for the presence of influenza, and more detailed symptoms cannot yet be ruled out.\nHowever, after seeing other symptoms, you can immediately form a panic panic by going online and discovering the symptoms that are most common. Still the best bet is to lie down and wait to check up on yourself with your team doctor, or use a trusted physical exam to make sure your fever is actually from influenza.\nOther similar symptoms include the eyelids drooping hard or adding volume, jaundice, fever, difficulty swallowing, loss of light, and joint fatigue and chronic constipation. You should be able to carry the same symptoms with you to checkups at hospitals and pharmacies every three weeks.\nWhile people who are admitted to hospital feel better, it’s not for everyone to always show symptoms. Some people may feel better after one visit, such as while on a walk, but it may be essential to make the treatment even better.\nIt’s not always very clear if flu is caused by flu viruses (including lupus and empanda viruses) or if you are sick with swine flu (or are otherwise infected, in which case it may be influenza virus), but officials have confirmed that it’s now become possible for travellers to visit the World Health Organization (WHO) site.\n']"

No human bear-in-the-sun,” Modi said.\nAs for the malaria outbreak reported in the US, “We have asked the people of India to bear the burden of this mosquito-borne disease. They should bear the burden for the countries affected by it. Government officials should wake up and try to establish its health status by linking it with the river or the sea in a timely fashion,” he said.\nModi said India had begun establishing vector-borne immunization centres in 85 villages across the country, adding that there would be a screening mechanism to check for the disease.\n“We hope to start the process soon,” he said.\n""]"
480,Coronavirus: Strict measures could last 'significant period',"['The childhood immunosuppressant (which may have its own major symptoms) is arguably the world\'s germiest infectious disease. With more than 9 million cases diagnosed annually – known as the AOCQ – there are hundreds of different ways to kill it.\nCurrent laws, like those around the world, prohibit women from having certain types of sex or sperm if the male is sexualised and the sperm is unusually stored in the space between the two sex chromosomes. The pressure of the unknown remains quite great. How can anyone expect to die?\nThis week, researchers at Scripps Research Institute are getting close to that first sign of this threat, which may, or may not, be showing up in older generations of people. They\'re studying a trait called ""diprotectoc – my diprotectoc"".\nIt\'s a dyspeptic and negative-chemical reaction that happens when a molecule with an overlap between two chromosomes detects the nerve cells of a faulty strain of cyclical diarrhea: and all that happens is a man growing old and getting sick.\nThe mechanism behind this phenomenon is relatively straightforward: it goes through the male genome. But what could be this missing part of the epigenome?\nInsulin is a molecule used in billions of animals and humans across the world, spreading disease. It\'s just one gene or gene+2.4, one cell type, often the exact same number or diversity as the other. Unlike most pathogens, it\'s stored in the genetic sequence of proteins or cell DNA.\nThat\'s the only way to know which genes are the cause of diseases, let alone what causes them.\nScientists have known for a long time that a gene variant can cause a biological problem, but it hasn\'t revealed in detail what happens in millions of people. Can\'t a copy of this gene result in autism, paediatric epilepsy or a virus?\nIn the future, the cell will be able to carry out exactly the same function as a copy of that gene. You could replace the original DNA with a whole new one. Your brain\'s epigenome would not work as well as it has.\nBut all evidence suggests it\'s a much bigger problem. To avoid a disease, we need an efficient way to track the source of problems.\nThe McCovey health clinic in Boulton-le-Dupour, Northamptonshire, is attempting to do just that. It\'s one of three clinics in the UK receiving clinical trial data through an experimental GP research project. They\'ll team up with scientists from the Bristol Institute of Regenerative Medicine to do ""superbrushing"" in the cell from the outside. The testing will see three different versions of the same protein mix applied to the human subgenome. If each version of the protein produces changes that have the same characteristics, these changes will be made gradually over time.\n""If these checks can lead to finding genetically related causes of certain diseases, we might know much more about the risk factors of these diseases,"" explained Dr Anne Bolton-Chadwell.\nThe team says studies with humans will be accelerated by this project. Patients will be tested with the Pringles team of scientists. They\'ll then swap bits of RNA, molecules and proteins. The molecules and RNA will make it harder for the Pringles team to discover disease-causing mutations.\nIf the step is adopted, these synthetic new drugs could be unleashed alongside a vaccine that would spot the earliest sign of a disease.\nOnly 50 per cent of the world\'s people are born with baby McCovey\'s gene, Professor Elliot Miller of Scripps says. It\'s a gene that is widely mutating with human development.\nIt\'s an obvious way to fund stem cell research, but you can also help develop vaccines. It might not work as well as an unknown gene, but a drug could.\n""The McCovey is a diagnostic tool for age-related dingo-infection with Ebola,"" said Christopher Lloyd, director of emergency medicine at Swansea NHS Foundation Trust, who led the project. He says the results of his research will help the field ""move forward"".\nThe McCovey research will soon be expanded to use other forms of therapy to treat diseases like Lyme disease, gastroenteritis and COPD. It\'s possible to fund clinical trials with virus-free blood donations and genetic sequencing of possible environmental factors in developing strains of genomics and vaccines.\nAll the science, however, is still incredibly murky. Why does the DNA from McCovey\'s have a sub-threshold shape? Could a molecule capable of causing disease may be getting trapped in the molecular machinery that creates the disease? And what is the true state of the frog\'s behaviour?\nFor the moment it\'s just a question of finding the key, enough to prevent catastrophe. While the AOCQ is certainly getting there, worrying as it is that we may be seeing']"
481,Coronavirus update:: Why does staying at home help?,"['LONDON – Scientists have found that staying at home early in a flu outbreak might prevent the spread of the virus, which has become one of the world’s most deadly diseases.\nMeeting and monitoring both the intensity and duration of infections, and whether they go undiagnosed is vital to assessing whether the disease spreads through contact with another person or even from a contaminated drug, with researchers reporting:\nTo determine how safe a person is at home in this case, five sessions of light radiation exposure are run out of large rooms in the body by a light detector (light source) attached to a computer. The detectors are used on average just over three hours a day, each lasting four hours at a time.\nSome people on the scale of sickness will wake up in the middle of the night and may not think much of leaving home. Others may receive flu shots during the day but will not notice until well after they have had the vaccine, and they may feel very stressed at any point.\nThough this might not seem as alarming as if someone in a bed opens up to a farting virus, it was an accurate count of 7,500 confirmed cases around the world over 4 days in 2016. The rate of infections is among the highest in the world, with around 14 million people now infected with the disease.\nGenetic analysis suggests that the vaccine is one of the signs of progress in preventing the disease, as the amount of mucus provided at the other end of the disease journey has declined, researchers noted.\nHome instead for flu check up, whether it is potentially infectious or useful in diagnosing a threat, researchers theorised.\n“People are going to be in a better position to make the decision about where they live if the vaccine leads to any health-related risks,” said Dr Lisa Smith from the University of Oxford.\n“Patients who are at risk are generally sensible to stay home with their family. We used five very important tests – for example, asking people to age well, or give their given age – but we also checked what we thought were the signs and symptoms, so that too we had to classify the change across the populations in the trial,” Smith said.\nHowever, she added that for patients where the vaccine does not produce any improvement in symptoms, or has that effect on infection, there’s an incentive to stay home.\nDuring a hospital stay or when they have room to breathe, this is not enough, according to Smith.\nLike their ancestors, flu can be difficult to diagnose and the disease will not be fully recognised until research shows the vaccine works and will carry on as one of the first indications of resistance to the vaccine.\nCurrently the research team publishes a wide range of potential new antiviral treatments on the website Dusituromyceni.co.uk .\nScientists use these to look at every link between the virus and all the flu-associated organisms in the animal kingdom and all those infected at risk.\nThe reason why the vaccine’s efficacy does not seem to be replicated by many viruses in different ways, and that, they say, is because there are many others that can be tested in the human laboratory and therefore be the only test available to test the vaccine on the human population.\nThe “familiarity” associated with the H5N1 strain of influenza has also brought more attention to the vaccine, they said.\nHowever, Smith warned that like the flu, over half of the human population is at risk of getting it, so it wasn’t a bad idea to get a national version of the vaccine.\n“What was worrying about then, is that in what were a relatively short-term perspective there are still many viruses for which it was unlikely to find any effectiveness until the vaccine did,” Smith told V3.\n“It might take some time to demonstrate that it has any impact on seasonal influenza infection rates, particularly among the extremely large populations that do not get the vaccine.”\n']"
482,Coronavirus: How close are we to a vaccine or drug?,"['The effects of immune cells from an animal model that were found in humans at the start of the outbreak have been serious enough to prompt scientists to conduct a review, according to a report released yesterday.\nReuters and Israel Daily reported on the study, which estimated the virus caused 212,400 incidences of septicemia — an infections typically caused by parasites – and that vaccine or drug development was critical.\n“We are lucky to have a virus that damages several tumours or tyrosine conjugates in a given group,” said Joseph Sze, a professor of neurobiology at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). “Our study shows that it has a cascade effect, with this one responding as a virus response. We would hope that since fewer among us were killed, we can prevent the loss of our organs and nerves in the future.”\nA vaccine would be “definitely superior to the one given on other viruses in the study,” Sze said.\nThat said, scientists have learned too late that the gene Beta T16 that controls the immune response is outdated.\nHorizonCast, a three-dimensional vaccine research firm based in Israel, began looking into vaccine development in the mid-1990s. The last time they looked at it was the time after the 2011 outbreak in Washington state, because mutations caused the virus to develop at a higher rate than before.\nThe best candidate was the virus called L1. In high school, most students adopted children from families that had given them L1 fluoresce, even though it was unknown whether kids had been vaccinated against the disease.\n']"

485,Coronavirus: Domestic abuse victims 'still allowed to leave home',"['Coronavirus (CV) is common in humans, but the virus is particularly common in the home. In combination with those other hot button diseases like Lyme disease, cataracts and salmonella, it infects 90 percent of women and 68 percent of men in Scotland.\nToday, there are 15 different types of CVs issued by NHS England to help mental health services across Scotland.\nScotland and Wales have the highest prevalence of CVs. Further down the UK, UK trends for cases of that disease show an increase over the previous year.\nTo prove there is a link between CVs and abuse, we have grouped victims of domestic abuse with their attitudes and behaviours, often making it difficult to understand how they could suffer.\nRecently, there have been reports of women still being let out of their private home and creating domestic violence in order to escape the pain. These were common experiences during adolescence, they resurfaced in the worst cases with parental orders, and they cropped up again into the national lexicon, and could have helped to spread from person to person.\nBut after all this anxiety and conflict, there can still be a genuine fear that your family members might end up here. Having living in a home to commit abuse should definitely be avoided in the first place.\nBritain\'s National Audit Office has begun a review of domestic abuse/abuse charities. However, the report says the notion that reports of abuse have not been sufficient has become an issue of concern.\nIn particular, all the reports mentioned do not state unequivocally whether crimes related to domestic abuse were committed. The issues raised were the stigma attached to sexual abuse, being afraid of children and being bullied by family members.\nIt notes that the majority of the reports of abuse related to domestic abuse are also to older people and that the issue is likely to be more hotly debated during the recommendations process.\nIn research by NHS England, it was found that ""even some severely violent incidents reported by a child’s family member can have adverse effects on the child as a whole.""\nResearcher Katy Meister said: ""With many people concerned about any children being abused in their home, there is much that we need to be thinking about. These are simple but serious issues and this government\'s statutory duty should come into place to make sure we receive the comprehensive welfare check that children deserve from their families.""\nMr Danny Kell, Scottish secretary for health and social care, said: ""While we are committed to reforms to prevent domestic abuse through mandatory signs and co-signatories, we are always vigilant about preventing the further spread of signs and can ensure that we have policies in place to prevent issues being reported as well as taking action to stop abuse being perpetrated by others.""\nIt has also emerged there is a threat to the majority of calls for intervention. Around one in 20 calls for help have been made. Government documents indicate that 23 out of 34 MPs have received an abuse letter in the past year, with 17 coming from families making a complaint.\nMr Meister added: ""Recent news has prompted urgent responses from officials in the NHS and private sector to prevent further abuse, particularly of victims who are losing out to those who have already been abused as a result of proceedings like judicial decisions.""\nA related report by VisitScotland points out that between 2016 and 2016, £240m was spent on domestic violence awareness and support in Scotland, although it does not indicate how much funding was available.\nEmail left a message at yourcentral@ukmetro.co.uk or leave a comment below\n']"

Like, ‘I call you a salesperson.'”\nEarlier this week, Trump used his Twitter account to denounce the ICBC as being “not a good fit for the current Bureau of Labor and Industry Standards,” which he maintains is a “bureau of Labor Standards that’s headed by Seamus McCaffery.”\n“The Stupak family of companies are not a good fit for the current Bureau of Labor and Industry Standards,” Trump said in a tweet Friday afternoon. “I would like to apologize if the Stupak family was not a good fit for the current Bureau of Labor and Industry Standards, because they weren’t created by any other name. They had come of age at this time when people could earn $250,000. If someone wants to set up a phone call, they can’t have that type of contact. They call them up for all sorts of reasons, not the least of which was that the group was bleeding their staff. This was the plan that they had from day one. The strategy was to hire people in the middle of the night. “The decision was taken a while ago to give people a longer period to be able to get the information out if they get caught selling ads, but it’s something that I believe that the law and the policy is supposed to allow. I hope there’s some sort of work done with the rule to overturn this rule.”\nTrump’s tweet now redirects to an address at the Republican National Convention, in which he pledged to lobby for the rule change.\nOne suggestion included using phrases like “sell agents” and “buyers” to distinguish them. There was also talk of the U.S. population as an “institutionalized agent.” Trump has repeatedly stated that he thinks President Obama should apologize for his administration’s inaction on the Vietnam War, which he would most likely use to stop construction workers for Trump’s infrastructure investment plans.\nA Walmart representative told Business Insider a desire to keep the tradeoff from using the term “sell-sales team” in debates — a move that was first discussed at the union hall in January of 2015 — has led to a growing discussion about the authority of the current CFPB guidelines.\n“The time for complacency has passed,” Denise Kacko, vice president of labor and employment at Walmart, told Business Insider. “Reasonable conversation is required.”\n""]"
487,Coronavirus: Trump backs away from New York quarantine,"['New York (AP) — President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he will not back away from some of his decision to put on hold New York state’s long-sought ban on certain imported dogs and cats because of the recent outbreak of chlamydia.\n“I’m making absolutely no changes to the way we’re doing this — because I believe that protection for cats is the best way to stop that disease,” Trump said during a White House news conference. “I’m going to do it based on what’s best for the dog population in New York.”\nThe ban on certain imported Chinese imports has been in place since last year, when the state medical board ordered lab testing on hundreds of dogs across the state. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that around 20 percent of the dog population in New York was living in China.\nThe quarantine on Chinese poultry imports has been extended to include the U.S. pet parts market, making it legal to import medical supplies of any kind.\nThe ban on imports of all Chinese pork and other poultry remains in place, with the state agency now saying it does not have proof that the imports are safe.\nAmong other things, the Trump administration does not want to allow imports of genetically engineered Chinese sheep, even if they are not actually bred for pork.\nNew York’s quarantine moved along in the past several weeks, with senior officials from eight agencies joining the President to push the issue. The plan is expected to be finalized before mid-May.\nThe new ban is “nothing new.” It follows a longstanding policy adopted by the Massachusetts Board of Veterinary Specialists in 2015. That ban and several others led to an outbreak in August.\nSteve Papasi, medical director of New York’s state Department of Health, said many New Yorkers may not have purchased pork a couple of years ago, but was awaiting news on the growing number of infected dogs from a new strain of shrimping chlamydia in the state.\n“They really need it,” Papasi said. “It doesn’t seem to have gotten better.”\nGail Ellward, a 15-year-old West Canine Hospital resident in Crossville, is one of those who would likely prefer to get vaccinated against the disease. Her suffering comes at a bad time.\n“I mean I’m really sad because I think the health care system is over the top,” Ellward said. “I’m just really concerned about the food line.”\n———\n']"
488,Coronavirus: Lack of medical supplies 'a national shame',"[""Members of a Canadian military hospital and staff still struggling to access staples after suffering a serious illness in the Army (AFP)\nA study by a leading Canadian health researchers has ranked Canada's lack of medical supplies as one of the biggest health concerns in Europe.\nLast month, a Canadian soldier's body found in his bathroom amid a months-long understaffing process for medical supply embargoes was also found to be carrying six to 12 staples or liquids in its container.\nResearchers at the research hospital in Winnipeg discovered that the accommodation – which includes tents, lighting, changing rooms, showers and their contents – is too cramped and in poor condition for people to get medical treatment in a timely manner.\nThe study, titled “External Supplies for the Canadian Army - and Infection Transmission in the Canadian Occupation,” led by doctor R.C. Stadl, is published in the British Medical Journal.\nDr. Stadl said that the lack of medical supplies such as staples or boiling water brings to mind the case of a British soldier dying while serving his country.\n“We thought that the access was so poor that the soldier would end up in a similar situation. But we ended up discovering that there's a scarcity of hygiene supplies everywhere, a situation that we call ‘a national shame,’” Dr. Stadl said.\nThe problem has also led to cases of Legionnaires' disease, which have started to strike the Canadian military in recent years, and is an international drug-disease and pneumoconiosis outbreak.\n'Little knowledge of Legionnaires' disease' in the military https://t.co/8mPw1z5K2m — The Canadian Forces (@CanadianCommishR) March 29, 2019\nMedical supplies: 517,117 ‘reports of shortages’ in Canadian hospitals 'inadequate' https://t.co/d4ffPGQpW8 — Global Affairs (@Global_Assistance) March 29, 2019\nAs a result, people visiting hospitals are missing their refillable disposable toilets and disposable showerheads.\n“There’s no state-of-the-art in-house water technology … and certainly no toilets that house contaminated dishes. It’s just the basic necessities, like regular water,” Dr. Stadl said.\nDr. Stadl said that basic things “that are not readily available” are “typical of a citizen soldier, unless their homes are contaminated.”\n“Even if you live in a remote area where food is scarce,” he said, “this is where an army member can’t spend one paycheck talking to their spouse and their children about food.”\nRead: A war and famine in China : How starvation in Africa affects health\nAnd while keeping antibiotics and vaccinations in the home is a major issue for the Canadian Army, doctors say that making it safe for soldiers to work at their own expense is essential, according to a CCJ editorial accompanying the study.\n“With nearly everyone prescribing or receiving prescribed antibiotics on a daily basis, the Canadian Forces has limited resources to purchase goods of all types and in particular do not lack essential hospital supplies to go to,” the editorial states.\n“A prudent care approach is essential if an Army commander wishes to maximize services and activities associated with the Army,” the editorial adds.\nThe controversy has also resulted in the military receiving about 70 billion litres of contaminated water in 2019 alone, according to a Canadian Forces spokesperson.\nAt least 100 cases of Legionnaires’ disease have been reported since 2016 and 4,776 people have been infected.\n""]"
489,Coronavirus: How long can I exercise for each day? And other questions,"['Nothing brings me joy more than a dose of lemonade or the yummy takeaway and a drink or two of coffee. The more I exercise, the better I feel — good feelings about my morning routine and a good, long-term effort to reduce the risk of bowel cancer.\nIf you’re planning a workout, or if your doctor is tracking your progress on the grounds that exercise can trigger chronic bowel cancer (CBD), this study suggests that exercise could play a huge role.\n“Patients are social creatures, and they tend to engage in seemingly random activity when they’re not alone,” says Suzanne Gates, Ph.D., a professor of clinical ethics at the University of California, San Francisco. “Fortunately, we tend to stay to a broader extent when our needs vary.”\nFor a few decades, the most common causes of cancer incidence — let alone diagnosed by early menopause — have all been associated with lifestyle changes, including organ transplants and inactivity.\nOver the past three decades, GEM reports in the Asthma and Allergy Journal have also linked these with increased risk of cancer. In most cases, high blood pressure, diet, and associated environmental factors have been the cause of cancer. But in recent years, high blood pressure as well as smoking and high blood pressure have been reported as having health risks to both genders.\n“There’s a high chance that some of these cancers could be reduced in previous generations,” said Kate O’Keefe, M.D., chief of family medicine for Colon and Vascular Surgery and the investigator in the GEM study. “My guess is that any impact we’ve seen on the home remedies, dietary habits, smoking or alcohol intake, could suggest a pathway for mutations in the GEM and UC.”\nWith about 32 percent of adults who have had an at-home colonoscopy every year, an estimated 14 percent of gastroenterologists believe that at-home colonoscopies should be given to as many patients as possible, with an average of five patients per patient per year. So next year, when GEM is included, one in five men will receive a colonoscopy every year. And only one in five men will do so at any age.\nHaving open-heart surgery or recurring retinal-cancer screenings is not the only treatment that patients should consider.\n']"
490,Coronavirus: Is the NHS ready for the surge in cases?,"['Coronavirus: Is the NHS ready for the surge in cases?\nAs the incidence of the bird flu virus eases, the number of cases has fallen to 6,100 as of March and there have been three more confirmed cases reported so far this year. This makes it 4.1 per cent higher than at the same time last year. However, this is all the more alarming as, unlike people who claim that the disease is a fungal infection, it is not a viral plague.\nAs such, there is one question that should arise with the surge in cases: can such a disease spread beyond the borders of the UK? Many of those affected claim they have faced ‘manipulation’ when they accidentally but do not understand that this is a bacterial infection.\nThe illness can be very contagious and can spread easily, anywhere by touching people’s surfaces, while leaving a trail of infected flesh. Though this is why some cases are not reported at all, eunuchs and piggies can also travel this way: the illness can be caused by the ravaging spores arriving from somewhere else or even from a person’s body fluids.\nFortunately, it does not require any particular training or medical treatment to deal with the virus. The underlying cause of the outbreak is simply too easily identified. That is what the Consumer Healthcare Authority (CHA) identified last month. After being alerted in May by the public, and the ongoing outbreak with six cases so far this year, the General Health Research Unit (GHRU) announced a finalised response package for the government. This is the six finalised measures already in place that the government considered to manage the outbreak, from pre-departure and during surgery to treatment and medication.\nOnce the outbreak is identified, the continuing pain is likely to extend beyond the UK, even to countries across Asia and Africa. A culture of fear is also evident as this travel change, without warning, can follow with travellers applying for information about the virus and the CHA believes it will worsen outbreaks, though there is still a high risk of transmission to another person.\nAnother strategy to combat the virus is the hygiene element. During their campaign last year in the US, eleven states had declared outbreaks as public health emergencies, with the highest outbreak claim seen when a man infected with a virus was in the Washington state forest.\nThe testing of gloves is considered an important element of disinfectant treatments. However, even while these tests are being conducted, the main objective is to get the message across that the virus is not, and is not safe to infect individuals. A total of 63 outbreaks were declared in April 2018, and results so far this year have shown that 80 per cent of outbreaks are being reported under safe-news conditions.\nAlthough as we may assume that all of this is inevitable, with the move by Health England to reorganise its adoption of disinfectants for disinfection for injectable drugs and disinfectant tests for now, the infection will probably stay high for a while.\n']"
491,"Lockdown, what lockdown? Sweden's unusual response to coronavirus","[""As we have reported before, the Stockholm Police announced two days ago that they are going through a routine review of the DNA profiles and convictions of people exposed to coronavirus in Sweden. Public information and methods of identifying potentially fatal strains have been required, of course, but they have not been successful and the investigation is still ongoing.\nA Swedish man was found dead in a bed of cold and foamed at his body on January 26. The man had called his 21-year-old son three days before.\nThe old airman had killed himself following widespread flooding in a seaside resort in the east of the country. And then things happened to his new employer — or should we say industrial park manager — when he was killed by a taxi car accident.\nMore than 500,000 Swedes have experience of coronavirus. A surge in the number of coronavirus cases over the past year has brought you the epidemiology of pneumonia. Polio and measles caused 80 percent of the vaccine and roughly 3 percent of children.\nThis might sound creepy, but perhaps most spectacularly, there was a coronavirus outbreak of 1926 in the United States where a hospital refused to carry a bed full of seasonal flu vaccinations for its all-time highs. The parvo in this outbreak covered the entire North American region and the CDC's treatment plan was new and unlikely.\nThe numbers of these seasonal flu cases far exceed that of pneumonia, measles and influenza. Yet the never-before in-life crisis cases over the past several years have a special chill in the air for Scandinavians. And the preliminary findings released this week make it possible to understand why this has happened: Although there was a documented outbreak of coronavirus of influenza in England, a “cold-man” flu vaccine was not made available to the general public in the U.S. as of late 2016, and coronavirus killed 31 people in the U.S. that same year.\nThat leaves the early days to look at what happens to the viral strain and the virus in combination. And that is where the dangerous, yet insanely effective method is most helpful.\nThere is a case of Stockholm syndrome in which the coronavirus strains produce antibodies and enter the body safely. It is hard to form an antibody against which to attack the viral gene. But you could enter the immune system and your body could tell the virus that it has come from the gene. This is a bad thing for the flu. It removes potential infectious targets and your immune system could develop unexpected blood and skin diseases.\nYes, there is the risk of serious liver damage and, when possible, death from this very disease. But how often this will occur in the United States? In fact, there are no vaccine covers for the Victor bacteria that have been on the vaccine list in the United States for more than a decade. In fact, in the years that have followed, around 20 vaccine products have been marketed in the United States for this way.\nSo, what is it about this approach that was so novel and innovative? One of the leads is that the Luftwaffe, one of the world’s most technologically advanced anti-VICVD weapons, has developed special strains. This breakthrough presents a problem for the U.S. military and personal medical contractors who have most benefited from the expensive standard version. After adding G-Section and OnePlus 1 to their super-powerful missile , the Luftwaffe has created a new system that involves transmitters throughout the body, placing them both in the same network, via a single radio chain. During a combat training exercise, which utilizes the power of the transmitter, a G-Section radio directly detects whether or not the Americans have a lost fit.\nAt first glance, this treatment sounds like crazy news. But what does it really mean?\nClinical trials reveal that in the last decade, some of these scientists have also developed ways to activate either the membrane proteins in the Coravirus gene or LNDNA in the influenza gene. Other viruses are hidden in vaccines that only unleash they.\nBut the possibilities are limitless. If you’re lucky enough to have one of these vaccines, you’ll have a low-life flu flu. In other words, if you don’t like their method, you may be incompetent.\nJust because it sounds like it may be safer doesn’t mean it will work.\n[Photo by Luc Lacroix/AP Images]\n""]"
492,"Coronavirus: Things will get worse before getting better, PM warns","[""Social media users are used to trying to get by with no answers.\nBut on Wednesday, the National Center for Disease Control warned it could get worse before it gets better.\nIn a statement released on Twitter, the CDC said that it sees “signs of post-electoral stress in the U.S. every month” – 18% of normal American adults, including seniors, teens and kids.\nMore: ‘F*** Your Phoney Campaign’: a conspiracy theory in which Donald Trump’s reelection campaign released a plan to ‘break up' foreign nations\nAnd there are still “suspicious changes”, the CDC said.\nLet’s start with death\nAccording to the CDC, people with low incomes, poor wages and substandard health care often die by the tens of thousands each year in the United States.\nWhile the general population is resilient, the older age and stress of one’s health can make it harder to get ahead. By the middle of this decade, this gap will have a profound impact on the national health care system and the quality of life for people with low incomes, high rates of disability, and a high rate of transmission of infections.\nIn the majority of cases, rising temperatures and sustained global warming are the main factors affecting human health. But even below this trend, I suspect people in high-income countries will still experience some of the same stresses. (When the US is warmer we go up more.)\nIn order to prevent and treat future cases of vaccine-preventable disease, our primary responsibility is to provide early access to vaccines, as well as better diagnostics and better information about how to prevent diseases.\nHowever, prevention would be a lot less effective, especially given that the medical profession is split on on what to do.\nThis study is not the only warning\nThe article said, “Data have been provided by more than 70 governments on the transmission of disease and how they address these health risks.”\nThis seems to be a pretty good assessment, and suggests that “health industry groups like [the FDA] use the risk factors as a tool for targeting vaccine-preventable disease messages to employers.”\nIn short, if we simply go through the emotional demands to treat our own needs and problems, we may still experience a hit to our health.\nWhile the CDC said that the job of the public health worker is to “educate, support, and communicate with the majority of Americans who believe vaccination should not be used in public health,” we will see a lot of “challenging changes” over the next 18 months – and perhaps decades.\nCulture clash\nInstead of addressing education, particularly for disadvantaged children, the CDC said that we “should focus on health management of Americans who are low-income and/or households with chronic conditions.”\nWe should be moving away from policies such as the “referendum on vaccination” and encouraging people to reject legislation that would have provided certain vaccine-preventable diseases to children under 5 years old, a position that the CDC said “across states.”\nSolving our problems through science will require a resolute response from government officials and public health professionals. Because we know that safety is key to our success, we need to ensure that we protect our children from needless harm and for very healthy people with low incomes.\nSo, perhaps we can have a revolution in medicine, one that addresses the challenges of managing chronic illnesses through positive education, motivating people to prevent and treat disease, and socializing the many families that are too poor to vaccinate their children to prevent an epidemic.\n""]"

This is most common type of Coronavirus (RV) but may affect people younger than your age.\nFortunately, the majority of people can breathe easier with these six symptoms, but sometimes there are the worrying consequences – often an allergic reaction or cancer spread.\nTypes of Coronavirus\nAs the animal warms up – and the virus reacts directly to human surfaces, causing problems for our eyes, noses and throats – its chances of getting into a person’s eye is extremely high.\nThere are estimated number of cases of Coronavirus in the UK, so there are cases everywhere at times.\nAccording to a report by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPHA), there were 14 confirmed cases in England and Wales from February to September, but more than 70 people were diagnosed in England and Wales.\nThe first few weeks of each month is a normal 12-week period for people to start taking Coronavirus symptoms.\nOnce the symptoms are under control, symptoms can continue for several months. A 12-week window where symptoms appear the following month is the shortest at risk, but also has the greatest potential to bring about significant changes in people’s life expectancy.\n“Survival is high when there are high numbers of cases – but is always high if you treat and prevent symptoms, especially when the disease starts to spread.”\nCause of death\nCoronavirus can be spread through contact with a person’s eyes. Most people do not realise it until later in life.\nDuring the course of routine screening, an RRPHA patient with at least 5.5% remaining body fat should undergo a full period of meningitis.\nA Coronavirus patient undergoing Coronavirus treatment should undergo 5.5%\nThe RRPHA report looked at the common symptoms of people infected with Coronavirus:\n• The eye no longer produces any results\n• The gut, or esophagus, is infected\n• The left ear, tongue, nose, or throat may be infected\n• The bladder can be contaminated\n• The stool over the course of a week may be contaminated\nOther symptoms include:\n• The chills, eyes and nerves: The left ear may be affected\n• The blood appears to be contaminated\n• There is always the possibility that infection may cause permanent damage to the eye\n• The chicken will likely chew off its own patch\n• The potential for infection to spread more quickly\n• The skin may be contaminated, leaving your eyes open\n• The gut is probably contaminated\n• The fluid will become removed or removed immediately\n• the skin may be covered\n• The skin may be contaminated, leaving your eyes open\n• The eye may not move much\n• The mouth may be contaminated, leaving mouth open\n• The tongue may be contaminated\n• A lot of bleeding is found from an eye infection\nHave you ever been bitten by a mosquito? You may be affected by the symptoms associated with the virus. Here are seven common dog bites in your area.\nWhat is the virus?\nRVS V\nRVS was originally identified in the 1920s as the virus that causes the virus to attack the human body. It is an Aids virus and can cause stomach and eye infections in humans. A bit found in a marine mammal is in particular high risk. Other infections are commonly seen with the parasite Nephrotia.\nThe virus is spread through bites from bird to mouse and from the bat to milk. This can lead to limited symptoms in humans.\nDakota Coronavirus\nRVS is usually found when the body has become infected with an organism called microcystinosis and the transmission of the infection is carried with the host.\nDakota Coronavirus\nRVS was previously not listed as a safe sexual activity for people under age 18, but has been significantly recognised as a sexual activity for older people.\nUntil further notice, people who want to stop taking painkillers or other sedatives should take their painkillers or relax medicines for six weeks before taking them again.\n']"
494,"Pelosi: ‘As the president fiddles, people are dying’","['House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) joked with reporters Wednesday that her party has “just not got it right” for the economy — especially in New York. She outlined her for a three-part panel discussion in the House chamber during the time she had full press access, telling reporters “it’s easy in politics to fiddle.”\nPelosi is famed for not only her criticism of President Donald Trump, but for her criticisms of how her Republican party handles most of her party’s legislation. She added, “I remember during [Donald] Trump’s election and the government shutdown, [Democrats] saw it as a sign they were losing the politics and putting down their own system.”\nRep. S. California’s Cañon City Republican, Jonathan Miller, was represented by Democrat Matt Salmon in the interview and said some Democrats have dubbed Pelosi the “Communist Immigrant of the GOP.”\nWith Trump signs removed from desks, part of Pelosi’s policy for building infrastructure or building the Navy Yard this week or taking a new war zone away from the government, Miller told FOX News he sees the newly elected congresswoman as a conservative populist but a campaigner against “the tyranny of the individual.”\nPelosi was asked if Trump had “made” the order during this week’s recess to fire Mattis.\nShe laughed and responded that she “never has.”\n“The call came after he ordered our Navy to put down our buildings, which I agree with,” she said. “It’s kind of offensive and it happens in politics sometimes.”\nPelosi repeatedly interrupted Miller to ask what President Trump said in regards to immigration, which she claimed he said “walked the hallways, made his way up the stairs and walked the halls.”\nMiller said he also does not see any Trump policies in action.\nShe also said she has “no problems” with companies working for foreign governments, explaining, “The administration’s approval rates, in the briefings, has been consistently higher than the EPA’s.”\nPelosi also addressed Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) a couple of times in the history of the GOP, arguing against President Trump’s economic agenda.\n“Tax reform has been ineffective, and we still have more in our way to do,” she said. “The budget has been cut by as much as $20 billion.”\nAsked if the economy was still strong, and if Trump could “really put his ideas into law,” Pelosi said it was the opposite.\n“The country needs jobs,” she said. “Not to make up for the fact that the entire economy is just playing politics.”\nPelosi declined to name the Senate majority leader, saying later it was not in her agenda and that “he did not want to talk about that.”\nAfter Miller ended his interview with Capitol Hill reporters, Pelosi was asked why she had never discussed the economy before facing the press.\nShe said it’s because while she had “nothing to spend” at the presser “it is exactly like sitting down with my boss.”\nShe refused to go into additional detail because the ongoing government shutdown has reached its point of no return.\n“I don’t know why I couldn’t have [that day] too,” she said of the continued shutdown. “There is so much they don’t have.”\nOn the midterms, Pelosi expressed anger at Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\n“What do you think?

495,"Former Sen. Tom Coburn, known as a political maverick, dies","['Former Sen. Tom Coburn, a one-time Republican holdout who penned new tax and spending legislation years ago, has died at the age of 95.\nCoburn, a veteran, was diagnosed with cancer in November at his home in rural Oklahoma, said Minnesota Congressman Tom Emmer. He died Thursday afternoon in his medical home in Jackson, Minn.\nEarlier Thursday, Coburn and the 68-year-old Allen Hubbard were embraced by the Iowa Caucus/Caucus Caucus throughout the evening before the end of the caucuses in Mason City, Iowa. He signed the House-passed House budget bill Tuesday.\nCoburn — an Oklahoma native who grew up in Lower Mount Rushmore — was the first Republican to win Senate and Senate titles during the 1990s, when he was scheduled to run for two open seats on the U.S. House of Representatives after retiring in 2011.\nCoburn was the first to publicly come out as gay, a position the state embraced under similar legislation introduced a decade earlier.\nBut after a stint in the Senate, he won passage of his attempt to defeat North Dakota\'s incumbent, Republican Joe Manchin, and lose control of the Senate. One of the biggest changes was to replace Democratic majorities in both chambers of Congress, keeping conservative Republicans from putting forward bills on the floor of the House and Senate.\nCoburn was one of the lesser-known reformers of the 1990s, pushing an array of bills that sought to improve U.S. relations with Cuba, eliminate the death penalty for torturers and broaden access to gay and lesbian legal recognition.\nIn 1986, Coburn appointed himself to the Senate Intelligence Committee, overseeing bipartisan efforts to introduce U.S. and Cuban technology that had been virtually unheard of in that era. Coburn also was a non-party appointee in the Senate, but he was reluctant to legislate his views through a largely partisan body.\nIn 1996, he narrowly defeated Henry Hyde in a close November GOP primary that could have been a referendum on the influence of the Cuban government, and he defeated the effort to dismantle the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, one of the most unpopular immigration law-changes in U.S. history.\nHe was hired by the governor and then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry as a liaison to Congress, under his Republican Party\'s Haley Barbour, and the congressman also worked as a staffer for then-Senate Majority Leader Dick Durbin.\nCoburn didn\'t endorse any Democrats and had only close allies with the GOP in the 1990s, losing by only 10 votes.\n""He was a hardworking, brave, articulate leader,"" Huntsman said. ""A remarkable human being.""\nCoburn held jobs at a State Retirement System of the University of Tennessee, a Krav Maga Inc. subsidiary and a Peabody Institute for Management and Public Affairs.\nCoburn and Hubbard were co-authors of two very popular tax and spending bills in the 1990s — the first of which cut by $96 billion the estimated cost of Medicaid expansion under the Patriot Act. Hubbard and Coburn wrote the tax-writing legislation, which would have given the state the required ratio of each dollar added to Medicaid — all of which were subject to a $1.50 cost-sharing adjustment.\nBut in 1995, Coburn and Hubbard broke ranks to end that time-honored effort, voting to repeal the Patriot Act in support of the repeal of abortion coverage in pre-K, high school and college exams.\nCoburn was criticized by his close friend and Democratic opponent, Bill Daley, for laboring through the 2000s as an outspoken critic of the Republican president.\nAs chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Coburn\'s attention shifted to investigating the bridge collapse that cost billions of dollars and ran up millions of dollars in debt. Daley eventually promoted Coburn to chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus Caucus, and when he couldn\'t persuade Rep. Emanuel Cleaver to vote for the bill, he cast his vote with 52 Democrats to reject it in a 99-26 vote.\nIn 2004, Coburn started his National GOP Congressional Committee. As chair of the group, Coburn worked alongside more than 1,500 former GOP staffers.\n""All the memories are there and a lot of the folks that were and remain in the NRCC are fond memories,"" he said in 2016.\nAssociated Press writers Deborah Daniel and Lindsay Hayes in Washington contributed to this report.\n']"

That’s because there’s a good reason: a key presidential campaign in 2020.\nUnlike the Democrats’ gubernatorial and congressional races, the Klobuchar campaign made it clear that it intends to focus in on her husband’s coronavirus, Hepatitis C. In this week’s Huffington Post, Klobuchar shares what her husband and others have known from video he recently shared on the campaign trail.\nIn the video, identified as The H2O “Dasuchus” via a Twitter user, Klobuchar takes a snapshot of his father’s plane ride from France to St. Paul, Minnesota, after it crashed in Yemen and brought the government’s planes to touch down in Minneapolis.\n“These are pictures in horror and I just wanted to share them,” Klobuchar said. “I’m just so proud of my husband’s screenwriter dad, who also to this day writes in to watch movies and share these with my dad. Thank you for sharing this with me.”\nIn the video, Klobuchar also criticizes ABC News for making her husband, Demetrius Klobuchar, appear on it.\n“The fact that ABC interviews him is quite a story, so they should have gone with the definition of what ABC News defines as an interview,” Klobuchar said. “For me, that’s going to be a story where people are able to get a sense of the background. And I really want to be seen as being able to do that.”\nKlobuchar and her husband did not offer much in the way of specifics but did agree to share the narrative.\n“In regards to health care and health care for the next 10 or 20 years, I think the Dems and I are going to have a hell of a plan for health care,” Klobuchar said. “My vision, the plan, is that in 10 years, medical decisions, changes in the regulatory structure of things, health care outcomes, anything that’s going to happen to health care. I think the policies, the big new reality of health care is just right now. We’re all working together.”\n']"
499,House passes $2 trillion coronavirus package — but not without last-minute drama,"['WASHINGTON — A little more than a week after the House voted to pass an $816 billion plan to tackle the measles and mumps outbreak, the Democratic majority on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted on Tuesday to send it back for debate. But the final line-up needed more intial attention.\nRepublicans initially sought Tuesday to completely shred the $2 trillion package, which included an annual $2.6 trillion budget for defense and domestic programs. But Democrats attacked it for undercutting other potential savings: $500 million for preschool for kids with stunted learning and $50 million for anti-vaxel programs and heroin and alcohol addiction prevention.\nEven after a near four-hour vote on the spending bills, the Democrats said they had defeated the $200 million development benefit for Title X; $852 million for Iraq and Afghanistan programs; and $15 million for the World Health Organization to give extra money to public school nurses.\nHours later, Obama and his administration were traveling to Congress to table the funding bill. House leaders presented the bill to Obama on Wednesday and said he would sign it at their next meeting next month.\nWith the House up for renewal this week, many of the three tough votes along with a scheduled vote on tax increases as well as budget budget measures are resolved over the next few days before President Donald Trump\'s big first meeting of 2019 with members of Congress.\nThe most immediate action could be at the White House, where Republicans will begin to spend time pushing Trump to change his mind about the plans before they head to the Capitol for a closed-door meeting on Friday.\nFirst lady Melania Trump won the backing of House Speaker Paul Ryan to address the influential group of fellow House members Sunday, The Washington Post reported. Trump had encouraged Ryan to go, as had Wisconsin Rep. Jim Jordan, who shares a rare policy goal for Trump and his administration — to expand Social Security to meet the needs of all people.\n""I think he has to see something that\'s going to be very significant that he doesn\'t want to do,"" Ryan told The Post.\nHouse Democrats rejected the Democratic package, saying Republicans were using the pot of money they had to trumpet.\n""Every time we raise the issue of this bill the Senate comes and pulls something out to the president,"" said Rep. Joe Donnelly, D-Ind. ""The president\'s proposal has been anything but bipartisan. It\'s essentially a wish list ... it\'s providing substantial resources for Trump.""\nSen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., introduced a measure providing another $600 million for an international prevention and response program the same week as the House vote, saying that it was a ""substantial step in the right direction."" Gardner said it would provide ""fundamental skills, increased access"" to caring for vulnerable women in medical care.\nThe Trump administration opposes the Saudi prince\'s accession to the Saudi Arabia crown prince\'s throne after uncovering a covert nuclear smuggling scheme that netted the businessman\'s son, Prince Turki al-Faisal, while catching a North Korean nuclear test this year.\nThe American people recognize how important the global fight against the spread of the MMR vaccine is, and Republicans contend that understanding the value of it should help offer some answers.\nRepublicans ultimately added the $1.6 billion ""multiple million dollar"" spending money for opioid education, anti-smoking efforts, substance abuse prevention efforts, food aid, mental health interventions and national security.\nBut if the addition of at least some money is needed on day one, Republicans said it may be too late.\nThe World Health Organization says 7 million people die each year from measles worldwide, but that figure is projected to rise to 10 million by 2025.\nThe new funding package appears to put a stop to tens of thousands of cases nationwide.\nThe Senate\'s bill already has 50 votes, and other attempts by a Democratic senator to kill it failed.\nRep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., who leads the Democrats\' Black Caucus, defended the GOP\'s vote as a ""good opportunity"" to fix and protect the nation\'s defense commitments.\n""It will address the need to protect our soldiers and their families from certain threats and difficult situations,"" she said.\nAnd Muriel Bowser, D-Colo., leader of the Democratic Party, said the seven-vote total for the package ""confirms it\'s up to the individual lawmakers and individual senators to come up with the final legislation.""\nIf the White House, Senate and House don\'t come up with the final legislation soon, the deal could move to the same resolution as the House bill, she added.\n___\nFollow Isabel Lopez at http://twitter.com/AlinaLopez\n']"

501,Irate House lawmakers scramble back to D.C. amid fears of coronavirus vote delay,"['WASHINGTON – House Democrats sent a series of letters yesterday to senior House Republicans as it becomes ever more apparent that they are being forced back into the race for their House majority.\nUntil today, every House Democrat had put forward an amicus brief urging D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser to vote to confirm Emilia Crocker to a second term as mayor of D.C. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California said she was leaving calls to her two full-time fundraisers.\nD.C. Sen. Richard Blumenthal said the main goal was to give the Democratic majority they currently hold a 51-46 majority.\n“We need to have some definitive confirmation process as we have all this announced that we’re gonna get into the race,” Blumenthal told CNN’s Marc Lamont Hill.\n“It appears to me as if this transition is very interesting,” Blumenthal added. “We’re supposed to have a moment to show our gratitude to everybody, to everybody that have been very supportive of our effort to be able to do a very small number of votes.”\nDillencio Arroyo of the D.C. Transportation Association, a local body that represents the hundreds of Air Freight carriers flying by immigrants and millions of Americans, said Democrats are most pressing for a full-fledged confirmation vote by the Feb. 27 deadline set by the Obama administration.\nThat would mean the next Republican congressmen, Reps. Jerrold Nadler of New York and Scott Garrett of Garrett and Zoe Lofgren of California, would be required to do all the work of a nomination process to garner bipartisan support.\nBut Gonzalez of Colorado and Gonzalez’s colleague Al Franken of Minnesota remained committed to moving forward, given their own race to be their next Democratic senator.\n“It’s going to be a powerful challenge for these two men to demonstrate their support for the 113th Congress,” Garcia said.\nGarcia was left in no doubt the support he got from Democrats had already helped reverse the direction of the chamber that came late last year, when it fell short of an easy legislative majority.\n“We’re feeling a lot of momentum right now,” he said. “There’s a momentum shift that I see that we’ve had for a good several years now, like in 2008 and 2009, and this is a giant step forward.\n“I think this is a true testament to a congressional leadership that has elected our president on what we feel are well-respected issues.”\n']"
502,Pelosi eyes next relief package as Republicans downplay need,"['WASHINGTON (CN) – House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi wants to table another of her so-called hitches, asking Senate Republicans to take more of the blame for their failure to pass the Democrats’ package earlier this week, and to establish a $2 billion supplemental budget for fighting domestic and international terrorist attacks.\nBut Trump loyalists have been blaming Democrats on numerous reasons, including the fact that much of the Senate’s own legislation was watered down and Republican unity largely collapsed into the House version, which did not meet the promises of Republicans like Pelosi.\nTrump also said he’s already negotiating with House Republicans and is likely to deliver a measure to pass the House by week’s end.\nPelosi’s request to delay the move or move on to the next congressional session comes as Democrats and their allies charge the House GOP with supporting bills to protect victims of ISIS and other terrorist attacks.\nThe latest proposal came late Tuesday, after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer brought it up in the House Tuesday.\nIt’s too late to legislate, and the Senate wasn’t even close to passing a passing, plus-sides bill, in the first day of the 2018 midterms, when Democrats have already cleared a second round of can’t-pass bills to prevent devastating drops in federal spending.\nPelosi said she wants to come to the table and negotiate with the House Republicans, as well as the Senate Democrats.\nHouse Republicans are also skeptical about the demand.\nTrump could drop the legislative efforts before Thanksgiving, according to a letter from House Republican leaders. But if House Republicans can’t pass an appropriation or a balanced budget item before the beginning of the year, then Democrats are unlikely to intervene, the letter says.\nHouse Republicans are expected to offer a long-term funding package, with a revenue boost to help pay for long-term domestic and international terrorism prevention grants, the letter says.\nTrump wants a U.S. border security measure from Democrats, which the House may also consider as part of the larger package. The president wants to revamp the end-of-the-year Omnibus, which House Republicans failed to pass last year, bringing in large tax cuts for business and salaries.\nThe new foreign policy draft would create a new border security fund, prioritize airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, and set more powerful sanctions in place to stop the flow of goods and funds.\nMost Republican lawmakers believe the president should replace the House’s No. 2 authority, the budget process, with the Senate and the health care bill.\nPelosi’s office is likely to leverage the resistance against spending in order to give White House aides more authority, deputy White House press secretary Raj Shah told reporters on Tuesday.\nShah also said Democrats are “looking for contingency measures, but we hope these can be deemed funding measures to be necessary, appropriate and consistent with what House members can do themselves.”\nRep. Collin Peterson, a Democrat from Minnesota, tweeted Tuesday that he was “sending my thoughts and prayers” to Pelosi. The first three of his House colleagues have offered to pitch Pelosi’s request as “controversial.”\n“This is a radical agenda of a corrupt Congress, coupled with Mr. Trump, that is set to bring disaster across the country. Time is running out to respond and get this spending bill done,” Peterson tweeted.\nPelosi has been campaigning with Democratic lawmakers for months, despite their differences and even with the Senate’s willingness to compromise.\nIt isn’t clear whether she will make her proposal before Wednesday, when Trump’s veto has expired and Democratic leaders have indicated they are less confident about the House package.\nLike this: Like Loading...\n']"
503,Democrats delayed stimulus bill to tighten ban on Trump family profiting,"['WASHINGTON — Democrats said on Wednesday they expected legislation allowing the use of relatives to create jobs on a committee hearing they say holds little value beyond making certain to increase children’s participation in the federal workforce.\nFailed $10 billion package for the Obama administration’s 2010 stimulus was delayed for a second day as the White House argued it offered a glimpse of progress on the housing recovery and scoring political points with voters.\nDemocratic lawmakers in the House introduced a bill paving the way for the House to pass through the House to send the job creation measure back to the Senate for markup and passage.\nDemocrats said the details of the legislation remained sparse, reflecting frustration among some House members over their inability to support legislation on the labor bill approved by a bipartisan vote earlier this week.\nDemocratic leaders said the bill was nonetheless on course to reach its goal of being passed before the legislative session ends on Tuesday.\nThe case for giving granny tax credits to well-off families living abroad as Trump’s guest to help build his brand was last heard in January, when the House abandoned an Obama-era proposal, putting first-class payers in a new financial lifeline that would allow them to offset some of the costs of paying for Trump’s five billion-dollar tax breaks.\nDemocrats said Congress should provide working Americans with the best possible jobs as it moves to move jobs forward from beyond the shores of the United States, following the continued growth of the labor force, which soared 29 percent in the year to 2018.\n“It is time to act boldly in a bid to attract and retain the skilled labor force,” said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California.\nThe House on Monday passed a bill that would create up to a dozen skilled immigration-lending companies through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The bill’s “new structure would allow the Treasury Department to loan the properties of entrepreneurs and others who use their company’s profits to finance the expansion of our nation’s labor force.”\n“This bill provides tax relief for previously unemployed workers, and makes it easier for the great majority of Americans who were forced to seek relief, to find work,” said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California.\nThe House Republican and Democratic leaders of the House also introduced legislation to put billions of dollars into disaster relief for Puerto Rico, whose 4.8 million residents are included in the bill. The hurricane devastated the island just two weeks ago and has not had a direct impact on the local economy.\nThe “American Opportunity Act” aims to fund relief operations in Florida, Georgia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and end tax hikes for current and future retirees.\nThe House action would create the White House Commission on Employment and Economic Opportunity, a nonpartisan group tasked with identifying ways to bolster the nation’s labor force. The commission would recommend ways to “grow and retain” people from within the United States, and it would establish a manufacturing recovery office.\nThe Republican leaders have largely held back on legislation to increase the unemployment rate — which they say is under four percent — this year, worried that Republicans will opt to prolong it and blame Democrats.\n']"
504,How the $2 trillion deal came together — and nearly fell apart,"['There was a money-saving deal in key parts of the deal, but no serious deal was made, lawmakers and officials said Friday.\nThe deal — for a total $20 billion in federal cash over 10 years — expires July 10, 2019, and lawmakers say they want a deal by the end of that year. The stock market would likely move on this legislation by late spring or early summer, or December, before the fiscal year ends, signaling a significant new fundraising campaign by fiscal Republicans.\n“There’s been no concerted effort,” Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., told reporters, talking of the final deal. “The real issue is getting that $20 billion to roll in at the end of the year, the end of the next fiscal year, that’s going to have a significant impact on our nation’s finances.”\nThe Senate tax bill repeals the “Obamacare” health care law by repealing a tax on premium packs, required enrollment in private health plans and several other aspects of Obamacare, The Wall Street Journal reported. The measure brings the bill back for a vote, but may not happen for several weeks, citing ongoing negotiations over a deal that will require major changes to Senate rules and still hasn’t been voted on by the full Senate.\nThe House intends to vote on its version of the tax bill next week. House Republicans have held out hope of finalizing the bill by the end of the year. It should be tax-free. A Trump administration alternative was the best way to push a tax cut through Congress — one that will not increase the deficit, nor curb spending.\nStill, some on the fiscal side of the country say the bill is a violation of the terms of the deal, especially that the money would go back to states. They’re confused about what’s in the proposed version. Federal spending last year, from the tax bill passed by the Senate and House, grew at a rate of about 1.4 percent per year, up from about 1.1 percent in 2011.\nSenate Democratic leaders’ approach to tax is different. Senate Republicans can easily reduce the income tax rate to 8 percent, reduce or eliminate its marginal rate to 3.7 percent or lower, give states flexibility to reduce the tax burden and put an end to the incentive to use health insurance for abortions. They’re also making no changes to the estate tax.\nThe draft legislation that passed the House would also reduce the estate tax from 12 percent to 12 percent of new income and phase out its corporate tax rate from 15 percent to 15 percent.\nThe plan also would lower the federal deficit from its current $3.7 trillion to $2.5 trillion.\nThe deal avoids the extra fiscal risks like losing the interest deduction for state and local property taxes in addition to remaining in place, the Journal reported.\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said on Friday that the compromise provides a way to replace Obamacare in a way that requires action, not politics. “What the middle class and working families do not want is an extravagant deduction that they pay full rate tax on,” Collins said in an interview. “This is a tax increase for the middle class.”\nTrump has said he wants to return to congressional control of the government, which could mean early elections or some form of power grab.\nTrump indicated during a September interview with Fox News, “Anybody that says, I’ll terminate the executive branch, I will, I will. I don’t think that’s a good way to run government. I think that’s a non-starter.”\nPresident Trump is expected to decide soon whether to make major changes to the tax system to reduce the deficit.\n']"
505,Here's what's in the $2 trillion stimulus package — and what's next,"['WASHINGTON — That’s the idea behind the “Jobs for America” package, of which President Donald Trump is largely on board. But what exactly makes this package sound so much like the one that Obama considered nailing down at the start of his term? According to The Huffington Post, it depends.\n“What’s in there for the most part is income equality for workers and for new jobs,” Obama had said in December when he made the proposal. “So what has been the focus of the package? And really in the context of an economy that is this big and vulnerable, this unemployment rate going up, we want an outcome that most people would find in their favor and not simply recast.”\nOver his term, Obama has expressed revulsion at the idea that government programs would never serve “many, many people” because they “we don’t know where to go.” But here’s a hint that he’s not changed tack.\nInstead, he wants a new way of thinking about building new jobs. The plan involves raising taxes on many wealthy individuals and people with major income loads.\nIt seems unlikely to spark a Republican backlash in a Republican-controlled Congress, since Trump is the one who has floated the idea.\nThe package, which would raise taxes on $1.2 trillion worth of households and raise the standard deduction in 2019 to $12,700 for single filers, is not a “stimulus” package, as the Congressional Budget Office has described it.\nInstead, it would offer a two-year, $1 trillion budget plan that would run the entire two-year budget of the fiscal year that ends in June 2027. And it would also end “repeal and replace” the so-called ACA.\nThe CBO projects the plan would add $38 billion to government spending over the next 12 years. The final bill for each of those years would be based on how much the total costs would be, and how much of a concession the government may feel.\nThe $2 trillion being proposed would bring the government’s annual budget in line with in the 1990s, about $38 billion, which was roughly equal to what Congress expected to receive.\nThat could be the sweet spot in the plan. The White House plan has received much praise from House Republicans, including Rep. Dave Camp, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who’s chairman of the House Budget Committee.\nBut Trump himself, who has said he’s more interested in how “very rich” politicians he’s calling rich than in getting elected, is eyeing the package’s star potential as a sign that he can get his own plan through without wrecking it.\nMany other companies have already delivered their shares of the package. Facebook, JPMorgan Chase and General Electric have all ended talks with Trump.\n']"
506,Senate approves massive $2 trillion coronavirus emergency package,"['The Senate approved a mammoth emergency bill on Friday that would protect 6 million children from the deadly coronavirus that paralyzes people from becoming infected with an uncommon virus.\nThe measure requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency to submit its next steps before implementing the lifesaving stroke prevention plan that’s been a front-runner in White House and GOP presidential campaigns.\n“No one should have to suffer like we did and it’s human nature,” Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus said as he read the bill before the panel sent it to the House.\nThe current Emergency Preparedness Act took nearly a decade to implement following a deadly virus outbreak that killed hundreds of thousands of people and ended up costing $1.5 trillion.\nA pass, or “citizen impact aid,” means states and cities are forced to do things like identify people who have not visited first aid or who need help to escape acute infectious diseases. In addition, states and cities would have to help the sick the sick themselves.\nAdvocates argued that this federal bill would substantially lessen the burden of the disease since it would enable states to afford to carry out the programs. The House has passed an emergency bill requiring domestic violence shelters to provide free sex and other services to people living with HIV and AIDS and a measure that would authorize the Pentagon to send 400,000 troops to and deploy to Mali.\nBy adding $2 trillion to the emergency fund, the legislation would boost federal spending on social services by nearly $1 trillion. When combined with spending on other immediate emergency bills, the budget for the 2018 fiscal year totals $900 billion.\nThe bill also expands Medicaid to pregnant women, adults with an Aids diagnosis, and pays for elderly and disabled patients to be admitted to emergency rooms for intravenous drug overdoses. The bill requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency to reach out to the states to handle these crises in a timely manner.\nRight now, the only remaining federal help available is to help the sick become vaccinated against Ebola, with around half of the procedures taking place in Texas and Florida alone.\nSenators had been working to get the Zika virus outbreak under control until last week when Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., joined the first responders. A San Francisco nurse who worked on multiple cases of the virus has been named in her upcoming court case. Warren and other federal officials have blamed the mosquitoes responsible for the spread of the disease.\nMany will be praying that both the health of the American people and the American public will not be affected by the Zika virus.\nDr. Nancy Chapin is a public health nurse at SCM.org who covers the virus in response to the Zika crisis.\n———\n(c)2018 the Mercury News (Marcy, Fla.)\nVisit the Mercury News (Marcy, Fla.) at www.marcy.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n']"

Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., said Wednesday that the nation’s 22,000-member Cuban community needs a job — and he’s getting it.\nRohrabacher, who sits on a House subcommittee on homeland security, said that more than 8,000 immigrants over the last decade moved to Florida or Alabama to gain in-state tuition benefits and other goodies. He also said that 439,900 people who were deported or transferred to a different state than they would have gotten in the past decade moved back to the nation’s 26 million people who can afford a better education.\n“It’s going to get worse,” Rohrabacher said in a statement. “For some reason, it’s gotten tougher for undocumented and unaccompanied children living in our country who live in dire poverty. It’s going to get worse, too.”\nIn other words, the racial and socioeconomic divide could widen and immigrants could find themselves not only living in living conditions more difficult than they have in recent years, but becoming more and more vulnerable as waves of newcomers enter the United States.\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services reported that the average annual migration of immigrants to the U.S. since 1959 has increased by 30,000 people. While fewer than three million people are from El Salvador, the county with the highest levels of illegal migration to the U.S. is Sicily.\nSome 25.5 million people from Mexico who live in the U.S. are illegal immigrants, and that is without counting people from South Dakota, the nation with the highest numbers of illegal immigrants in the world.\n“To have the fear of never having a job again is now both scary and unhealthy,” Rohrabacher said. “My colleagues in the House and in my subcommittee who should be worried should be worried.

512,How the House Democrats' stimulus plan compares to the Senate's,"['WASHINGTON – There’s too much debt and too much austerity in the Social Security system to be easy, too tempting or too hard to meet our retirement age, but overall, our current income distribution works well. Even more with the government’s spending cuts scheduled to kick in next year, a new report from the Congressional Budget Office lays out for us just how these two priorities are intertwined: that we will be able to keep making the full-time equivalent of nearly $8,500 a year for most households, while cutting taxes for 95 percent of them and freeing up more money for veterans’ health care.\nIf the president believes such an idea would not work, he can certainly afford it – or so it might seem. While the Senate took a slew of House bills to the floor of the chamber, the House approved only one, and Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, the next House Democratic leader, had no trouble telling reporters his bill “doesn’t have any offsets.” While there is debate over whether Washington can afford this kind of targeted spending, the consequences are clear.\nThe top recipients of Social Security benefits are those who were born before 1940 and worked at a lifetime to age 65 – whether they’re paying into a beneficiary retirement account or already paying into a benefit fund, the historical numbers of those coming to retirement reflect the benefits in the 1940s, then diminished or decreased for the rest of their lives. By the 2000s, most of those receiving benefits had moved up to either a benefit plan (mostly) or a senior benefit (including housing and child care). This week, the House passed a bill that $73 billion in reduced benefits would go to a benefit start-up and an earmarked block grant. That was an elimination not a concession, and it can happen – again, this time in the Senate.\nWith mounting debt, the U.S. has cut its borrowing by a third – $150 billion – over the last four years, and the CBO calculates that at present, the debt service liability stands at nearly $940 billion, with a maximum $255 billion left to draw from the Treasury Department’s regular treasury-cash reserves. If House Republicans succeed in cutting taxes to plug their $53 billion deficit, the CBO predicts, Social Security will have “sharpened its mix by raising benefits for 2.5 million new beneficiaries under 100 years old.” This new round of benefit cuts is precisely what Democrats want from the White House – legislation that “combines the savings from new subsidies for child care with some unspecified assistance for veterans’ benefits in light of the global financial crisis.”\nGOP leaders are already more optimistic on this issue – for a clear example, consider back to the healthcare bill passed by the Senate. With about $19 trillion in unfunded liabilities tied to health care, the conference report estimates that the measure would have $350 billion to $400 billion to cut through in savings, and would save about $1.1 trillion in premiums, charges and interest for health insurance. The White House can intervene as early as next week as it seeks to increase price tags for Medicare doctors and an extension of the Bush-era contraceptive mandate.\nWhat Republicans want now is not a plan that cuts benefits for 100 years, but merely a budget proposal that decreases them to a minimal level, and then unlocks the ballooning debt. Spending cuts they oppose because they are enshrined in congressional law, but they cannot be applied to every aspect of the federal budget – the 17-year annual budget of the Department of Transportation, for example, or the federal deficit, the national debt or the deferred benefit that often helps contribute to budget deficits. That’s really about all they can possibly do, at least until Congress makes payments to check not only a narrow monthly benefit, but also to the rest of them.\n']"

A VIR has applications for off-the-job registrations through the local registrar of voters, or directly via state elections officials.\nVIRs often work because a voter has a partisan interest, and much of them can be included in the electronic voting machines without necessitating any costly training of poll workers.\nVIRs have the potential to be used in more than 1,000 national early voting elections this year, Davidson said. The machines are being decommissioned or upgraded under next-generation electronic voting technology.\nAnd many voters have switched to voting online with the Internet, adding up to about $500 million in savings this year alone, Davidson said. He forecast the projected savings would begin to multiply as the machines mature and move to the same environment — often without much training.\n""We believe at this stage that, when people are really into voting, it will be important to not just get them out of the house in a timely fashion, but to get them (online) to go and vote,"" Davidson said.\nThe problem, Davidson said, is that the questions involve ""mass customization of the remote ballot.

Some lawmakers on the committee are worried about the default of the current Treasury debt limit, which could lead to higher interest rates on the debt.\nThe Treasury has already said it would shut down Treasury investment companies that were purchased by General Electric and Chevron.\nA law passed by Congress in 2010, which forces Treasury to pay for the financial crisis, has helped place a stopgap measure in place, allowing the Treasury to finance the rescue in early 2011.\nBut Congress and the Treasury have been almost always irritated by Treasury spending and congressional opposition, citing the need to make sure the Treasury never finds itself stuck with massive amounts of taxpayer debt.\nIn an attempt to retain some credibility with the Senate, a group of lawmakers introduced legislation to defund the fund. But two days before, the agency expressed opposition to the funding of the supplemental fund, a measure that was signed into law last November and has since been repeatedly vetoed by Congress.\nThe Treasury disagreed with that reasoning, saying it won’t try to manage the issue of how much the debt must be paid back to the public or what version of taxpayer funding bodies the Department of Justice and Congress provide.\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said the budget process for the Defense Department should be continued and the funding of the FSA, the agency that hires the police and fires agents, should continue as well.\n“Spending without any authority or timing is absurd and undermines our ability to conduct honest business in the banking, securities and insurance industries,” Jordan said in a statement.\nRep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) said he remained skeptical that Congress would honor Obama’s nuclear power pledge to build nuclear plants.\n“There are approximately 2,600 and 1,800 [nuclear plants] that have to be built under the next 20 years, with no reliable new generation,” Brooks said. “We know that in the next 20 years we will need a new generation to cope with the way things are working and that manufacturing and research are in need of expanding. The $205 million Congress sent to us should not be spent on trying to cover our current shortfall or escalating the cost to break even.”\n']"
522,Pelosi pushes forward with her own emergency coronavirus package,"['Updated, April 1:\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi announced Monday she will make the coronavirus a priority of the House of Representatives for 2020 and is personally involved in the opposition to a bill that would, among other things, require that crack cocaine powder contain laboratory tests for this virus.\n“Tonight, I will consider this legislation — that would amend the Controlled Substances Act to require manufacturers of crack cocaine to have the kinds of tests in place to detect this dangerous virus,” Pelosi said. “In order to do that, we need to discuss a universal testing kit.”\nPelosi has cited the manufacturing history of manufacture as evidence that this is an egregious problem. Further, she noted that a well-known inventor of crack cocaine was a congressman, and that there has been concern about similar material as well.\n“The quality of any crack cocaine in circulation is identical to any fentanyl or morphine cocaine out there,” she said. “In fact, it is the same per capita rate as morphine.”\nThe bill would protect not only crack cocaine, but any other types of drugs from being tested for the risk of using dangerous substance. As the House Judiciary Committee’s ranking member, Pelosi is a firm believer in producing lab-tested form of crack cocaine for sale online. She said the House shouldn’t be an obstacle to this possibility.\nThe House Judiciary Committee has until Friday to write a final version of the bill that would permit the testing of any crack cocaine product, but needs at least three more senators to ratify the legislation before it would be introduced in the House.\n']"
523,Sen. Rand Paul tests positive for coronavirus and more GOP senators quarantine,"['WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is taking a step closer to being cleared of the coronavirus that has left him nearly dead, and he tweeted about the situation Wednesday night.\nPaul tweeted his concerns about the Indiana lawmaker before she died at a rural hospital Wednesday. The Associated Press is withholding her name because she was not hospitalized and it is not clear what prompted her death. But the implications of her death are enormous and the shooting probably will deter anyone from seeking to do more research, Paul said in a statement.\n“The key to the fix is not to do more research,” he said. “But if I was to be elected president, I would recognize that if I were to be able to make vaccine available, most of the deaths of infants in this country would be prevented by public health measures, and it would start a tsunami of vaccine research. If the answer is ‘maybe’ I will be in office longer than I think many other Americans believe.”\nThe 2016 GOP presidential election was a bleak slog for Republicans. The party’s uninspiring presidential performance remained a major cautionary tale as lawmakers looked to avoid another disaster. And internal polling figures showing the GOP’s edge diminishing over the last week showed the party declining the presidential vote.\nPaul’s news erupted in rapid succession Wednesday as other Republicans elsewhere in the country who had started their own investigations into Hillary Clinton’s ties to Russia shut down for a week. His counterparts, the fate of Clinton’s emails, impeachment and inquiries into questionable connections between Russia and her political campaign brought attention to the country’s failure to hold Clinton accountable for her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.\nThe tension in Kentucky between Paul and Trump overshadowed the news, even though the death came less than six months after the Republican minority’s first female president, Barbara Campos, died of pneumonia at a Southern Baptist Medical Center in Midlothian, Texas.\nPaul’s tweets follow several others from earlier this week, all of which have bolstered Republicans’ willingness to keep probes going.\nGOP strategist Steve Ragan said Paul now has the right to make public his judgment on whether he feels personally affected by Clinton’s email scandal. Paul said he is confident he’ll be exonerated by FBI or U.S. Supreme Court. But he is also worried by the prospect of members of Congress visiting Clinton’s family for ongoing investigations.\n“It’s so damaging for a leader who has to decide how to interpret the actions of her son, if she is sitting down with him for interviews,” Ragan said. “She has a history of not wanting to be compromised and that’s going to be easy to maintain.”\nIn both cases, members of Congress are being held accountable for their actions as the impact of the Clinton allegations and investigations continue. Neither party has a speaker in the House of Representatives and will likely have a vice speaker the next two weeks. However, so far, no one has definitively lost his or her job over Clinton’s emails.\nRep. Nancy Pelosi of California canceled her speech Wednesday to mark International Women’s Day. She told CNN it would be the first time she had publicly addressed her family or leadership of the House.\nPaul has not yet responded to a request for comment.\n']"
524,FDA issues emergency authorization of anti-malaria drug for coronavirus care,"['DANBURY, N.Y. - A year after FDA said it would not order an emergency advisory committee to create an advisory panel to address concerns raised by the Food and Drug Administration about a drug it said shouldn\'t be distributed to patients over the counter without providing proof that its drugs are safe.\nThis is the first time FDA has issued emergency health advisories to the public. The advisory panel was convened to address unmet medical needs, particularly in hospitals and emergency rooms. The drug Uriminazole is an earlier-than-expected drug developing resistance to PAM, a human papillomavirus virus. Since its launch in the United States, PAM has caused miscarriages in most developing countries.\n""We know that this drug is not dissimilar to human papillomavirus vaccines,"" said Tom Costello, the FDA\'s deputy director for programs and medicine. He said it\'s a ""no-brainer"" for medical professionals to continue using patients over the counter for better care.\nThe FDA says the drug needs to address three more issues, but the request for an urgent medical advisory committee could also delay approval for two more years. The agency couldn\'t make the request last month because of worries about drug safety for patients under 50.\nThe FDA\'s emergency medical advisory committee is to be chaired by Commissioner Scott Gottlieb. The FDA has taken action to curb the supply of PAM, and has asked hospitals and clinics to begin dealing with the drug once a year.\nThe FDA said in February that the efficacy data from the Aitona study, in which patients got their PAM during a six-month follow-up period, were comparable to those seen with similar APFIP programs, and that the risks of accidental or unintended consequences were similar. That point has not been considered by the commission since 2018.\nThere\'s more uncertainty with US research on screeners who fell ill after checking for PAM.\nExperts say that APFIP can cause depression or anxiety.\nEPA issued a warning on prescription PAM in February after the FDA refused to agree to an advisory committee over its potential for health risks.\nIn March, the FDA\'s staff urged patients not to use drug-prescribed PAM if it had any risk. In a footnote to the FDA\'s report, the agency said that if doctors don\'t follow this advice or if it shouldn\'t be made public, then there\'s no reason for someone to use an APFIP.\nHealth officials say many more clinicians and patients are using APFIP in hospitals.\nIn January, more than 2,000 workers were placed on leave because they said they felt ill after reviewing side effects from screening mammograms to assess if PAM was effective. To date, they have only succeeded in preventing 2,700 patients from using the drug, and the FDA said they had faced more than half a million calls for help in the last year.\n___\nFollow Gary Fineout at http://twitter.com/fineoutAP.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to show that the agency won\'t order an emergency advisory committee because of concerns about PAM.

He expects it to take “the kind of broad permit” required in the early 1990s.\nPassengers include the New York Yankees, the two Airbus A320s parked in Dallas, El Paso, Austin, San Antonio, Houston, Winston-Salem, Syracuse, Norman, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Memphis, Salt Lake City, Kansas City, Beaumont, West Memphis, Little Rock, Grand Prairie, St. Louis, Dallas and Port Aransas, Louisiana.\nTexas already has checked most of its departures with incoming immigration. That study found that so far, states with high rates of immigration have more than doubled the amount of arrivals.\nThe U.S. State Department also reported 931 international departures for 2016. But there are plans to conduct another study this summer in which travelers would travel to more markets, replacing Paris as the country’s sole destination for departing with Paris scheduled to close Sunday.\nPowers says southern Texas, led by Brownsville, Texas, and Cole County, Okla., which includes Fort Worth, has experienced “continuous, consistent and continuous” growth in those departures. Texas got 10 percent more arrivals from Mexico last year. Texas had 94 percent of arrivals from overseas in 2016.\n___\nInformation from: The Texas Tribune, http://www.texastribune.org\n']"
526,New York leaders look at harrowing week ahead,"['WASHINGTON – The Pennsylvania-based Highway Safety Administration began to ration enrollment in its emergency vehicle program to help with the grim world of federal highway safety regulations.\nThese approved rules – which had once allowed the vast majority of state troopers to field their own temporary emergency vehicles – have had a contentious and dangerous time, plagued by questions over the safety of outgoing emergency vehicles, particularly with the death of a Pennsylvania state trooper on Oct. 26.\nThe top TSA administrator, Neil Wagner, said he first wants to see the risk for those involved in all emergency vehicle accidents as zero as possible. If the agency is more cautious, then he expects truck drivers to follow suit.\n“Our workers, our people, we’re going to be just as careful when it comes to HVAC crews as we are in a fire truck,” said Wagner, who will make his way up U.S. Highway 101 at the end of the week and provide briefing material during a Tuesday visit to Congress.\nWagner is expected to take part in committee hearings and the coming run-off election and is laying a detailed argument to the Federal Highway Administration, beginning with his main role as commissioner in the agency, responsible for all vehicle inspections.\nHe’s also expected to explain the state’s commitment to ensuring that such vehicles are built with winter gear, and to reveal the way the agency has to prepare for a February surge in fatalities.\nBut the agency has already focused on staffing reductions, a senior agency official said, with the goal of providing transportation services to millions of vehicles in need of repairs, including road closures.\nThe New York State Department of Transportation is also using its massive manual workforce to prepare vehicles for road closures, resulting in road closures that make emergency vehicles difficult to rescue.\nConcerns about departmental authority had spurred the federal-state Commission on National Highway Traffic Safety last week to propose changes in HVAC codes, but conditions remain a concern.\n“We have the ability to plan for the holiday and not the holiday season,” DOT Director Richard Trainor said Friday. “This is not a matter of monitoring the situation to the degree it is necessary. It’s an opportunity to become informed about alternatives, especially in light of the pending rule changes.”\nThe commission’s suggestions include expanding classroom space for students, ensuring that educators have access to software to allow them to monitor and answer questions in real time, and restricting the time any vehicle trips are covered by HVAC, according to Patricia Kessler, chief executive of the agency’s chapter on safety.\nWagner noted that advances in technology could dramatically improve safety because of the engineering of the regulations’ necessity. The cost for engineers to start works is estimated at $2.3 million, but signs have emerged of being used for commercial self-driving vehicles.\nOne challenge for the agency is getting driver safety measures in place for HVAC because drivers don’t know what they are going to do at the same time.\nThe future of emergency vehicles will depend on the level of risk and reliability of infrastructure, FEMA Administrator Brock Long said in a recent interview.\nLong said that if the department is overwhelmed in managing its response to an emergency, it should do something.\n“We’re focused on that, and we want the agency to get used to that,” Long said. “But we don’t want the agency to lack judgment.”\nSome safety experts believe that the agency needs to be more cautious about adopting new regulations, particularly the requirements for the HVAC rules to be allowed in emergency vehicles.\nThe HVAC systems already allow vehicles to be driven past daylight hours by fire engines or other personnel who can answer a mechanical problem or adjust brakes at home during the emergency, even if not in the accident. The exception is requiring driver safety on HVAC drivers.\nLong said the agency should also keep a close eye on vehicle maintenance and safety at all levels – including elected officials – and develop test programs for public service employees to learn the science of installing HVAC, and how they’ll be able to handle hazardous workloads.\n“We’re going to have some really good folks,” said Michael Barabot, president of the Pennsylvania Association of Emergency Management, which represents 600 private-sector emergency-car companies. “But safety in general is about the right things. … We have to give credit where credit is due.”\n']"

For example, health regulators are still unsure how many imported flavors are selling for $800 and those sold from the U.S. are exempt. Even the FDA acknowledges the industry has ""effective control of the [taste] residue inside"" its Stafela flavours.\nThe California Consumer Product Safety Commission has mulled issuing warnings about flavored products. The agency\'s process is similar to the FDA\'s, Britt said. The FDA is also working on rules to limit sagging oil, a sometimes-impacting ingredient for weight loss.

On Monday, Bayer officials announced the FDA was ""likely to consider"" asking it to adopt some of the rules for labeling, as opposed to just mandating labels in the first place. If the FDA refuses, Bayer will file for FDA review based on its compliance with the new approach.\nTrump top candidates have adopted the FDA approach as a way to lower the costs of serving too many higher-end food products. In 2017, those sentiments were on full display as Trump\'s administration rolled out the administration\'s second major food-industry directive in four years. As of February 2019, Congress was passing additional restrictions on packaged meat and beverages, while Trump is against them and along with Senators Max Baucus and Jeff Merkley is against them.\nThe FDA put the measures into effect early this month, pledging to ""unjustly chip away at consumer protection and improve efficiency"" of its FDA programs. Pruitt, the administrator, announced the agency would change just five aspects of its current programs in response to complaints in the last three months.\nOn April 2, President Trump\'s Cabinet first narrowed down the choices by acting on them before having presidential guidance written to create some time limits on labeling.\nThat plan could also involve changing the rules on S.A.S.L.L. but the administration hasn\'t committed, Britt said. It\'s ""in the danger of having some people put into the label for a different amount of food than what\'s going on with traditional food companies.""\n']"

529,Dr. Birx: States should copy New York on medical preparations,"['Unequal medical practices in New York should be equally pervasive and imprecise so as to abolish one-stop shopping to attract and protect fresh-out-of-school (FSU) students and other parents who want to avoid multiple forms of health care, because it violates all Americans’ personal rights and vices.\nSo what does this have to do with the college that should have the largest, best-regarded medical school in the country?\nWhat’s happening here is that New York State is being fined by the State Medical University Medical Center for not having all of its medical facilities at a single location — which is not within its boundaries and for charging excessive fees.\nAfter the Nassau case, the State Department of Health changed its medical policy, cutting one-stop shopping for several reasons, most notably its excellent dispensation system, which can immediately provide support, and by recognizing that where the wellness is most accessible — which is the medical center, but is not inaccessible — that access is a front-line decision.\nInstead of straight-lining for FSU students, for example, the need for multiple programs offered at the medical center is clear: Make the facility a one-stop center to support wellness education, especially for students and faculty, as well as external access to the same programs.\nThe Medical University, operating with an exclusive, full-service office in Tamarac, Florida, dispatches med students from the island for exams and referrals to the university’s medical service team, a team of physicians and psychologists, among other medical professionals that operate throughout the United States and district borders to serve all students.\nJock Greenberg, the medical authority of NYU School of Medicine, writes an editorial for Townhall recently, which I believe decries what he calls “the arbitrary and illegal way medical schools are discharging patients and faculty from their own schools.”\nIn practical terms, NYU should be prohibited from charging higher fees on FSU students in order to give students the convenience of the “free market of doctors,” Greenberg declared. However, the legislation being considered for approval would allow NYU to charge as much as $1,000 per student for study areas, which allow doctors to charge every student in a district-located location to participate. This would be “unethical” and “unwise,” from NYU’s perspective, given that people who want to be in a room full of doctors and have to remain in a room full of people will not be able to safely find that room.\nAllowing for FSU students to live and work on a college campus at a single facility — without any incentives for other residents to do so — would be inappropriate and wholly unjustifiable. It would also violate the principle of separation of powers, which in New York State clearly violates this amendment and will undoubtedly bring the cost of Cornell’s clinic at the Medical University of New York (“The Medical University of New York” is a direct response to the Medical College of New York (“The Medical University of New York” is a direct response to the Medical College of New York) into question.\nHealth care is obviously fundamental to the identity of America. There should be no reason for the State Medical University Medical Center to facilitate the “free market of doctors” on a college campus, since it will not just provide academic support for students, but will distribute medical service through the institution. Yet it can’t be restricted because we all share a personal interest in health care.\n']"

REUTERS/Marco Bello/File Photo\nPneumonia affects about 3 million people each year in the Americas. It is a vector-borne disease and widespread in the developing world. Without immunization, 90 percent of them don’t live to 60 or 90 years.\nA year after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a small study of blood blood plasma derived from two deadly strains of the disease, the diarrhea-like symptoms caused by the malaria parasite had been already difficult to diagnose as they appeared just a day apart, CDC head Dr. Lisa Borders said at the launch of a new report.\n“There’s been much work to demonstrate how malaria can really undermine that funding,” Borders told Reuters. “It’s clear that this epidemic is a very serious public health concern.”\nPatrick Walsh, the CDC director in charge of malaria immunization, said the poor health of people has led to a reduced demand for vaccine medicines and a disastrous response to the disease.\n“This is absolutely the largest death rate in a generation,” Walsh said.\nThe WHO said that by pushing malaria into pregnant women who didn’t receive enough vaccines, 33,000 kids died worldwide last year in the same areas because of prolonged access to their vaccines.\nBorders, who chairs the drug-policing steering committee for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said she was hopeful there would be an uptick in outbreaks of malaria in places where immunization is reliable and convenient.\n“It’s a level playing field, if not a completely free zone, in the world,” she said.\nThe WHO and WHO-sponsored research team released this month in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, looked at 46 different mosquito species that all showed worrying signs of malaria this year, with 68 among the 19 nations tracked. It suggested that some of these mosquito species had been at high risk of infection while others had received the vaccine or received placebo medications.\nFascinating mosquito populations also arose in similar areas. In Columbia, New Mexico, fewer than half of mosquitoes that carry malaria survive in the wild.\n“I’ve watched over-abundance of Malaria care on-site,” said Michelle Hershberger, deputy director of prevention at the National Park Service in Grand Bend, Indiana. “We’ve seen the numbers that are remarkable.”\nIf the CDC project pans out as planned, deaths from malaria worldwide could run at or exceed the annual total amount of deaths from HIV/AIDS, which has taken about 50 lives from malaria as of 2015, CDC officials said.\nIn Brazil, only about two in 10 people ever reach the 100-year average for malaria death worldwide. A worrisome number is getting worse.\nCDC had been testing for Zika to see if a virus-carrying species known as dengue was present in mosquitoes this year, said spokesman Craig Wright.\nIf tests show the virus is present, “it would be very helpful to coordinate the continued development of Zika infection prevention programs,” he said.\nThe WHO’s estimate of 10,500,000 new cases of malaria is hard to reconcile with that of actual deaths from the disease, so the CDC is not releasing its preliminary data or even comments on the method it uses.\nWhen much of the change happened as a result of the Zika mosquito and vaccine changes, Walsh, the CDC chief, said he was “assured there would be lots of improvement in the effectiveness of the mission.”\nAsked if the multidisciplinary unit combating malaria now taking part in government-led regional efforts would be able to avoid future cases, Walsh said “That would be an option,” and “we would consider it very much an option.”\n']"
531,Scott Gottlieb forecasts the next coronavirus outbreaks,"['The Europe-wide Asian influenza outbreak since January has raised the bar for swine flu concerns as scientific estimates suggest that more than half of all those who die are infected with the tropical virus. One strain of swine flu is expected to be on the high end of strains that were found in several countries including Thailand, Brazil, and China earlier this year. And new research suggests that there are few survivors of the worst flu pandemic of modern times - if any. A rare strain of swine flu - Rheemori - was found in six South American countries and Europe over the first five weeks of 2015.\nIn Australia, where the province of Merriam-Webster is known as the “Hospital” of Sydney, Australia’s National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) was led by Professor Margaret Cauchi. Professor Cauchi conducted various visits to people living in Australia from 2005 to 2015. Ms Cauchi, now professor of biochemistry at Victoria University, said her research revealed that the epicentre of outbreaks had a tendency to be geographically dispersed. “Because of population changes associated with chronic illness and restricted access to services, they tend to be more recent (complicated) manifestations of illness,” she said. However, there were only three countries that were particularly vulnerable to swine flu: Indonesia, Malaysia and North Korea, with five fatalities and many others under suspicion. “We don’t know the extent to which this will fall into the realm of conservation for vulnerable populations. “There are several hypotheses to suggest that this appears to be a symptom of different conditions in the population of countries similar to Indonesia. “They have ‘experiments’ – analyses of these kinds of predictions to predict how long the pandemic will develop.\n""Also, the main urban population groups, the people who migrate here from the northern regions, so the rural population that would pass through urban centres.” This sparked media speculation that there had been outbreaks in southern Asia. The latest H5N1 strain was detected in Saudi Arabia and a transmission had occurred in Malaysia. Professor Cauchi said that this strain had in the past been found in tropical regions of Mexico and Thailand. The WHO has given more than $3.4 billion to provide funding to research and development for H5N1 vaccinations in Asia. “However, that might not cover a full recovery effort, because it’s not yet viable as a medicine,” she said.\nWith the number of Australian infections in five countries rising to 8.5 a year, Professor Cauchi is hopeful that people living in these areas will still go to hospital when they need it. “That’s why I think we need to look at these challenges in this region of the world,” she said. The outbreak is “out of control”, the research group notes, and could push healthcare to its limits. “This is obviously a developing outbreak, but one that also has some problems, too.” In addition to the initial four strains found in France, Singapore, Sweden, and Australia, there have been six Canadian provinces, and five Australian territories. Loading Professor Cauchi said the communities most affected by the worst flu season were eastern rural South Australians, Aboriginal people, Aboriginal college students, and people living in inland regions. “We need a modicum of preventive care for people living in these regions,” she said. “In my opinion, this outbreak is likely to develop rapidly in far east India. “Most importantly, by and large, this outbreak is in harmony with the spread of Pangia, which is so viciously spreading these diseases.” Loading\n']"
532,Could Obamacare save jobless Americans from coronavirus?,"[""A team of scientists have discovered a viral virus that can cause cervical cancer without an underlying cause. But something strange is emerging in the lab as the company behind the project has been granted yet another federal patent.\n“We think it’s a virus that is designed to look like a tumor and not as the most likely cancer of the cervix,” Chris Cournoyer, a researcher with the UC Davis Department of Molecular Pathology, said in a press release. The disease appears to be not only benign but that all cells and tissues of a woman have metastasized into the cervical tract.\nThe designers of the virus, Dr. Robert Clark and Dr. John Smiede, believe in the idea that the cancer cells that cause cervical cancer need to be pushed into the cervical system so that they are no longer susceptible to infection.\nRight now, if a woman has a reported or suspected cervical cancer, she should receive a pap smear at the same time. But that isn’t the case now, when a screening program, like a cervical cancer exam, is required. And the HPV is used by more than 90 percent of women, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n“This is an exciting discovery that could have major implications for women and help protect them from cervical cancer in their lifetime,” Smiede said in a statement.\nSign up for the Power on Trial newsletter Get our insider's look and analysis of the key moments in the Manganos' retrial. By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.\nThe reason for that, according to Cournoyer, is because Pap smears for the sexually transmitted disease, HPV, are very common in people who have never met a woman before.\n“If we knew what the aggressiveness was of the cervical cancer, how they got to the cervix, we could be treating that patient in the different ways that we can,” he said.\nIn that new study, Cournoyer and Smiede examined the effect that women’s HPV infection is making them victims of cancer. They found that women with a high circulating HPV infection experience the most change to the cervix of any of the cancers studied.\nSo if a woman has the most of the HPV infections, for example, this affects much more young women than older women.\nSmiede and Cournoyer believe that the safety message of HPV vaccines is almost entirely based on how the cancer cells take on the HPV in the body. The vaccine has an associated tendency to produce aggressive and mostly unproven side effects and risk factors, like infertility, and making women more susceptible to inflammatory reactions that might cause illness.\n“We’re asking people to take the vaccine first, if possible, so that we can have some early warning about the supposed side effects of HPV,” Cournoyer said.\nThe analysis involved examining specific tracts in the cervix and the spread of the virus as well as the time between infection and transmission, and the amount of time between infection and the infection, according to the release.\nThey also took an external exam of patients to find out what kind of cervical cancer they were about to experience. Because the virus was within the specific cervix, researchers were confident that it was more likely to be benign than aggressive, Cournoyer said.\n“We do not believe this activity has ever been tested with a different target,” he said.\nThe researchers came up with this hypothesis because cervical cancer is more prevalent among women, which would mean a need for vaccination sooner rather than later. They specifically wondered why of all the researchers who have done this study, not to mention a team who are 30 years old, they weren’t specifically interested in making cervical cancer a real threat in women.\n“It is a question we have asked ourselves, which is just to see if we can come up with a way to make cervical cancer cases larger and less likely,” Cournoyer said.\n""]"
533,Republican governors buck Trump and stick with social distancing,"['Associated Press\nCHICAGO (AP) — Now governors who have called to criticize President Donald Trump and his policies throughout the 2016 campaign agree to participate in a new bipartisan fund-raising effort aimed at serving as a model for reform.\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is backing a new push by state and local Republican governors, announcing that he will announce his support Friday night. Jersey Republican Cory Booker and Massachusetts Gov. Andrew Cuomo also are stepping up in support.\n“After difficult debates over the fiscal cliff, we can’t stand by and watch this small group of friends and acquaintances in Washington, D.C., ignore what they know best: that policymaking is not about what is right,” Christie said in a statement.\nThe shift is significant because such a strong campaign could raise the profile of the next Congress and lay the groundwork for its next steps. At the same time, it signals the end of a concerted effort to repair relationships that Bush-era appointees would have lacked the credibility and quiet impact of previous administrations.\n“They can make the difference,” said David Wildstein, a professor of policy studies at Indiana University’s Western and Central School of Business. “It was like they said: ‘We aren’t going to let this get to us.’ It was the Reagan presidency.”\nThe Trump administration has dealt with the attack ads, with his criticism of Obama as the kind of Congressmen it intended to undo. Some of Trump’s decisions have done little damage.\nLawmakers from his 2016 campaign released ads as well as books that promoted climate change and resistance. It continues to be fodder for Republican and Democratic attacks in 2016.\nThe new funding effort between Christie and his colleagues came in the wake of a tough state budget hearing in January, during which the governors of most of the states also agreed to participate. The groups of governors signed a pledge to contribute to the effort, arguing that the social reforms Trump proposed wouldn’t pass the Republican-led Congress.\nChristie made clear he did not support the nonbinding vote, as Democrats have for the last several years. When Cuomo and Christie and New Jersey’s governor, Jerry Brown, announced the initiative, Christie said he “loves” having a fundraising group that would work on social issues with other governors.\nTrump’s target isn’t a blue state, where he couldn’t avoid his crusade for tax cuts. He has typically joined more conservative groups that are backing Republican candidates, saying they need to “rededicate” their support to Democrats.\nChristie, like Trump and some other governors, joins other Republican governors that have banded together to exert strong pressure on the Trump administration.\nIowa Gov. Terry Branstad sent an email and printout to Trump at the end of the 2016 campaign. “Unfortunately the administration is taking constructive steps to fix this mess that is wreaking havoc on our economy, its reputation and our democracy,” Branstad said.\nBranstad and Christie have significant “politicization” responsibilities.\nAt the White House on Wednesday, Trump said he would be willing to work with Branstad on building partnerships with the private sector and the public sector, but noted that he’s not a liberal or a Republican. Branstad responded that Trump’s priorities are not in the national interest, and that it’s the governors who are directly responsible for the problems.\n“We have a very complicated economy,” Branstad said. “I call it a mess,” Branstad said. “We need new policies to take it back to where it was.”\nBoth Christie and Cuomo have announced that they’ll be joining the effort.\nChristie won a key endorsement Wednesday from both parties in New Jersey. Cuomo, who has visited the state to campaign, said he’s excited for the new work of the governors who support him.\n“I think his responsibility is to offer government solutions and won’t be easily shamed by Republicans,” Cuomo said.\nThe Texas governor, a rising star in Republican politics, released a call-in statement Thursday criticizing Trump and the GOP’s policies.\n“I am proud to help to bring about change in Washington. My own failure to invest in the private sector has left the private sector with poor results and many of our most disadvantaged and hard-to-find young people without a steady source of income,” he said.\n—\nAssociated Press writer Gretchen Stevenson contributed to this report.\n']"

535,Health workers fear U.S. hospitals will become coronavirus hot spots,"['WASHINGTON (AP) — Local hospital nurses fear a recent outbreak of influenza virus that they believe could spread to all 35 U.S. hospitals will increase their concern about having to post signs of U.S. vaccinations that keep them in a hospital for days, the same day the CDC announces the first cases.\nSeveral newly confirmed cases are being linked to the week-long outbreak of the virus and newly diagnosed cases on Tuesday, said Dr. Jeremy H. Elkin, head of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\nIt\'s part of a potentially deadly mix of diseases nationwide, including swine flu. The virus that killed 19 people last year has spread to 12 other countries, mostly in the United States, Elkin said.\nSix U.S. hospitals were among 32 sites examined by the CDC. Two of the infections, two in Maryland and one in West Virginia, could be traced to the outbreak of the flu shot. But South Carolina will soon be added to that list, a person familiar with the outbreak said.\nU.S. health officials said the outbreak is the most recent since the CDC reported the first case of influenza in 1992. That event was linked to spiking of the number of pneumonia cases in the country in 1985 and the outbreak in 1985 that killed 1,473 people.\n""I think it\'s more of an opportunity that for health care as a whole, as a federal sector and an area of focus, that you\'ve got to address the issues that a new disease can bring,"" said Dr. Christopher Dehner, director of the CDC\'s Office of the Health Protection Officer.\nIn some cases, germs are running dangerously close to infection, like a switchblade with an infected meat cleaver, Schmitz said. But if an infected person is already sick, the CDC is not sure that a stranger could be caught.\n""In many of the cases, you don\'t know what to look for,"" he said.\nWhile no deaths have been reported from either of the reported flu cases this week, doctors and nurses say that because flu is already a constant threat — until one specific disease becomes pandemic, they usually only take it because it lasts all of eight months. Those 11 months are vital because the incidence of infection grows with every year.\nA recent Associated Press analysis of a study by the National Institutes of Health found that 74 percent of the roughly 90,000 people who were exposed to the virus have had to wait in a hospital emergency room to seek followup care.\n(Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

About 17 percent of all influenza cases are attributed to the virus. A health epidemic is still raging.\nU.S. and European influenza viruses are the leading cause of flu-related deaths in the United States, but the CDC does not track deaths.\nIn Mississippi, in Mississippi, Derrik Agender, who is 33, died of complications of pneumonia as a result of the flu, the CDC said.

537,Pandemic sparks new front in abortion wars,"['NEW YORK/(Reuters) - Abortion foes and activists worldwide are taking aim at the president and prime minister of Britain, a row between the British government and U.S. District Court Judge Kimba Wood, who has given initial approval to a sweeping abortion bill that she plans to alter.\nIn her ruling issued on Tuesday, Wood said the bill is likely to move through the U.S. Congress but has not yet been passed before, and that the bulk of the bill - with a few exceptions - may have to come before the U.S. Supreme Court.\nTwo years ago, prior to Trump taking office, Wood recommended the U.S. issue of death penalty and abortion law reform. Now that she has the U.S. Supreme Court on her side, she is expected to rule on future abortion rights legislation next month, possibly in part by using the legal challenge to strengthen the life and health of women.\nThe ruling comes a day after Wood rejected an appeal by Indiana\'s Republican governor, Republican Attorney General Mike Pence, in which his staff claimed the state\'s law at hand - which imposes life penalty ranging from six months to 10 years in prison for people convicted of misdemeanor sex crimes involving underage children - violated the federal courts\' jurisdiction.\nThose attempts by religious groups and other pro-life groups to secure an abortion ban in Indiana go back nearly five years. If the White House and Supreme Court justices can settle on a ""safety net"" law, most women in the United States, though there are exceptions for heterosexual married couples, are eligible for a federal income tax deduction, a public option for Medicaid expansion and a formula for child care funding, may get an abortion.\nAfter Wood received the data from the anti-abortion group ACLU, the group filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the ban. It triggered the Supreme Court to review her decision in September.\nThe White House on Thursday said it was reviewing Wood\'s ruling. Trump has fired his first attorney general for siding with the Catholic Church on key issues in the election.\nThe Supreme Court is expected to give its final say on any Texas voter law that seeks to ban most abortions after 20 weeks. That case, involving several women\'s groups, will be heard April 8 in the high court.\nThe Trump administration also moved to block the government from taking actions that “vindicates state’s right to privacy and due process,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement Thursday.\n']"

Rick Perry’s new stroke case puts the Obamacare pen back on the map\nBeing a public official does not have to be a total cobwebsmith. You can be inspired to follow in the footsteps of those whose brilliance and courage are apparent in their deeds.\nI am reminded of how strong and determined each one is. It is easy to think of those who have a sense of purpose and give to others and make a difference. But those who have been through hardship, frustration, gridlock and trauma are, inevitably, outside the reach of the spirit of common good.\nBecause the people I speak to are the ones who participate in something else – and do it in meaningful ways, to underscore our good will, compassion and partnership – I am honored to reflect on some of those who exemplify their talents.\nFirst, I must note that in my quest to revive the Affordable Care Act, I have had the benefit of “life after Obamacare.” Doing so allows me to continue carrying on an excellent foundation with great results.\nAnd then, it requires me to consider this interesting two-part challenge. First, it entails two serious tasks.\nFirst, by following Obamacare’s rules, and trying to achieve what is meant to be accomplished under Obamacare, I will find that initial failure (I will enter the Obamacare consulting business for health care, not the federal health care law) will soon be enough.\nSecond, I want to assess the potential for changes in Obamacare going forward.\nFirst, a few years ago, I put together a report based on an opinion of 600 physicians that heikhs would most likely like to see in the United States in 2040. In other words, even people who are satisfied with their current status could not love the new American health care system.\nSuch an eventuality would seem dangerously tepid. But that is not the case. And that is a good thing, considering that this is for someone who has shown an extraordinary commitment to making a meaningful difference.\n(The Opinion section of the Columbia Journal of Public Health appears each of the five chapters of the health care law’s newsletter, each with an opinion on what should be included in the public health report you must provide before any publication. In the New England Journal of Medicine, M.P.H., who served as chief medical officer of the Massachusetts General Hospital, two years ago, has published an opinion on what should be included in the report, also on what should be included in the public health report.)\nThe report is based upon a number of articles, including excerpts by several physician groups that have met privately with the Trump administration, so I am not trying to forecast precisely what the outcome will be, but I am far from sure that things will not get much better under the Trump administration. That is why I must make plans to open my position at the Columbia Journal of Public Health as an adviser.\nLet me close by wishing those who would like to help us achieve our goals on Obamacare going forward their good wishes.\nTrump in Arkansas\nIf you’re looking for the new president, please wait before heading to Arkansas, especially if you’re planning to leave the area and a waiver of health law for that state.\nIt is not just Arkansas and Trump, either. I have also traveled around America trying to convey my desire for a clean health care system.\nEarlier this year, I visited five states, including Alabama and Georgia, where I met with a diverse group of people, with each person agreeing on different things. And I wanted to make clear I stand in favor of sweeping reform and defending the health and well-being of citizens.\nWe should all join in doing so. It is hard not to.\nLet us be all Americans who love health and want the health care reform that protects people’s happiness, and provide healthy choices.\nMany of us have lost a close friend, a family member or colleague, and yet we still feel connected to them and try to work out their health problems.\n']"

He described the pilot health school as a positive step towards establishing a partnership between healthcare professionals and concerned citizens, and therefore needs to be expanded.\nMeanwhile, the ministry passed an ordinance to remove from the ministry a list of Health Watchmen, including medical experts working under the ministry’s medical supervision status system (inbox No. 123, No. 9, No. 8).\nSources at the Ministry of Health told JTA the revelation has produced an emergency situation in blood vessel and stomach. Nevertheless, the ministry said it was completely absent from the list because they were with their army, not guarding it. A hospital spokesperson said only the “institutes of this advisory” department had the authority to determine and control who was working in the police, while the ministry’s Medical Authority did not even take a position when a minor accident happened in the ministry.\nHe asserted that the ministry was doing its duty to ensure that hospital Atehil joined the public and necessary procedures, stressing that the principle of preventive measures was in total compliance with the law.\nMeanwhile, an update from Shaq said the investigation into another health care board has been completed and has to be opened as soon as possible.\nFollowing the announcement of the order, several hospital patients were attacked by thugs and other vandals during routine cleaning in the Raouf Hospital on Wednesday, Shaq disclosed.\nHis spokesperson said the authorities have not yet identified the attackers but there was no tangible incident to substantiate their claims.\nMeanwhile, a gap in payment for health care in the first quarter was half of a million dollars but due to the ongoing economic recession, health workers in the first quarter of this year faced relatively higher bill. According to GPM officials, the minister issued orders to ensure that the bill is strictly accounted for and that providers in hospitals are expected to share the costs.\nThe doctors recently have agreed to reduce their rates by between 5 and 10 per cent, GPM added.\n']"

In a preview of Wednesday’s speech from the White House, Quinn offered a personal conciliatory take against the Republican president.\nQuinn, a Chicago Democrat, blasted Trump for joining “a careless politician who takes power by just another mechanism and says he doesn’t care about the pain of our fellow Americans.”\n“I will keep making the journey home so that we are all feeling our full weight with our hearts and minds,” he said.\nHe joked about the Trump administration’s second HHS mandate, saying that while he would respect the will of the states that passed it, the president of the United States should be allowed to veto.\n""He’s an even stronger president than Donald Trump,"" Quinn told POLITICO.\nDemocratic lawmakers had hoped Quinn would take a harder stance on the nation’s opioid epidemic, but since Trump was elected, Quinn took direct aim at President Barack Obama’s efforts to scale back the nation’s opioid epidemic.\nHis praise for Obama led the union-backed American Health Care Act, which Quinn says helped help lead to his return to work at Fox News Channel’s Frontline. He said Obama is destroying families, and he stood by him before the Supreme Court on the issue of civil unions for gay couples.\n“He’s cutting programs that are actually doing just that and I love that,"" Quinn said of the legislation that showed ""a commitment from the governor to not acting without a little backbone.""\nQuinn on Saturday described the president’s comments as unprecedented.\n“I loved the length of his comment,"" Quinn said.

546,The Obamacare predictions that didn't quite pan out,"['Healthcare.gov.\nAside from: The ""jump off"" step\nWhat happens on May 23 at 3:00 a.m. is that the website will vanish. If you work for a private company, for example, the new federal law means you’ll have to apply for coverage on your own. That’s a nightmare to meet, and $2-a-person premium will really kick in on October 1st and land you a bill of $18,000.\nThe government doesn’t seem to care what the folks who manage the site are telling it.\nGoogle for Kids\nGoogle’s decision to expand its coverage based on age and income is being considered by the Trump administration.\nThe area would involve Google’s help workers plan out potential healthcare plans. Users should know there’s going to be a need.\nIf you are the teen who missed out on the child-care network for a single child, there’s no reason to worry.\nAdvice: Families planning to move can expect higher prices, plus uncertainty.\nGive Obamacare a Try\nImagine you can’t find the job on Amazon to meet your monthly expenses. You can’t find the doctor in your area, and expect the good doctor, doctor, or tax accountant who’s in your area. The Affordable Care Act’s “Comptroller General” will ensure that you have the information you need to make decisions about your life.\nThe federal government gets to decide who gets to pick and choose the doctor and physician staff. And regardless of what happens to the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies, hospitals, and other public health systems are required to give you information on any candidate.\nThe census data? Google users still have to register on their behalf, so do not “get out.” You’ll need to help local authorities determine who benefits from the health insurance exchange. This way, they don’t just, for example, cover the elderly who may not be able to find a health insurance agent.\nStart Social Security\nWho knows when Social Security will finally become a thing? It might happen in 2035, when most people realize that we will no longer be signing up for Social Security benefits.\nThis affects 72% of people who are self-employed.\nThink of this as a keystone of the expansion of Social Security — the so-called “solace of seniors.”\nSince Social Security is a commonwealth, Medicaid is not like Medicare, and Medicaid is administered by the state. Social Security provides employer-sponsored health insurance to the elderly, but you can find not one, but two choices about who gets to keep it.\nIt’s a calculated (if uninformed) gamble.\nAt 6:44 a.m. next month, the U.S. Treasury Department will create a portal at www.privacy.gov that users can create, take a snapshot of their use of their personal information to find out who has insurance and Medicaid. It will also inform users who would like to contact the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services about becoming a spousal care beneficiary. The idea of finding a spousal care beneficiary, offering this information, and the risk of letting the state do it for you, has changed history on this issue.\nSo far, we’ve not learned, at least so far, why the feds came so far.\n']"

The agency is choosing materials it would remove and having FEMA contractor inspectors in place to inspect where it is being bought.\nLong said he believes police can get the message out.\n""We just don\'t want to overstep our rules. We\'ve gone all out to destroy,"" he said.\nThe agency has spent days trying to encourage residents to get out of their homes and put their hands on the Missouri National Guard. The Missouri National Guard did not want the federal money.\nLong said the agency is telling people they shouldn\'t bring things to shelters or they shouldn\'t buy things.\nHe said the problem is rooted in FEMA\'s poor record on protecting civilians, and said those complaints should be heard.\n""I need to be frank. We\'ve made mistakes,"" Long said. ""But we\'re still, at this point, dealing with a serious issue of the issue of people being displaced.""\nFEMA administrator Susan Bellinger said she initially intended to stick with Long for a full week. Then, in March, she decided not to keep Long on the job because it\'s mandatory for each person whose insurance pays out. But she says she decided now because of his work.\n""We have not known where the expense of buying the equipment would go,"" Bellinger said in an interview with The Associated Press. ""I have not indicated who I would reimburse.""\nIn February, Long told the Orange County Register that his agency buys roughly 200,000 protective goods a month, but some of those go to people who aren\'t current on their insurance. He said they include pallets of clothing, gloves, rain boots, boots and handhills. Some items are costlier.\nIn December, Long warned against deploying the equipment because it was made by an Italian company, which has set its sights on developing a nationwide nuclear and missile system. He said the U.S. Air Force is buying about a dozen and will soon be rolling out 4,000 more during its fiscal year.\nHe also said he is opposed to drones flying over the center of Austin, Texas, but wasn\'t clear about this issue.\nBellinger said the agency has established 12 locations in the U.S. that will deploy the device. She said that while Long\'s experience last week has been ""remarkable,"" she said she would prefer that none of that be approved and moved.\n""We are treating the information that we receive with as much consideration as we want them to make and we would not hesitate to move resources that would be necessary,"" she said.\nThe Homeland Security Department won\'t have such a rollout until December, when the agency would have to complete all its annual review of performance, Bellinger said. Long said that he has not yet determined how he would like the FEMA equipment to be used. She said that extra personnel will be sent out into the event.\nLouisiana Gov. Steve Beshear said Tuesday that he wants more evidence of how the installation is being operated. He called for a review and analysis of things the state has paid for in the past. He said he has talked to FEMA chief Rick Rickard about moving a specialized equipment unit from one location to another or applying a new maintenance fund that will give a return if FEMA was told of a problem.\nAbout 70 generators have been used for the training and distribution of the equipment, Long said.\nBeshear said he is considering making that switch to another facility until there is more proven success. He said that requirement for FEMA to pick and choose equipment is unreasonable because on some equipment the program is at risk.\n""We are not looking at it on a case-by-case basis,"" he said.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Felicia Marcus contributed to this report.\n___\nFollow Rich Ord on Twitter at https://twitter.com/apismarnet\n']"

549,The state trying to turn Obamacare into Trumpcare,"['Last week, Donald Trump took to Twitter to take credit for the seemingly unstoppable decline of Obamacare.\nThe president claimed that “the flaws in the Affordable Care Act were broken and so should be replaced.”\nThe Trumpcare victory could only be described as “the worst thing in modern U.S. history.” But the facts are the real reason for the severity of the threat to health care.\nObamacare started with the requirement that Americans have health insurance and was meant to help hospitals get money that otherwise would be used to put people on Medicaid rather than offer them just insurance. However, a hit to the bottom line\nOf particular concern is the idea that so-called insurers might cut rates sharply or stop asking people if they have an irregular income. But that assumption is likely to fall to the people who do get insurance and who might be reluctant to pay deductibles and copays. Even then, perhaps the Administration won’t need the resources to persuade people to pay their high deductibles and copays in order to incentivize people to get insurance.\nAnother possible reason: the expansion of Medicaid.\nOne of the more regrettable aspects of Obamacare is the amount of government subsidies programs are demanding. A whole lot of politicians and labor unions know full well the desire to keep an enormous tax base to fund government operations — not just health care programs. Hence the demise of Obamacare.\n[T]he provisions in health insurance are probably better left for the states to decide, but not many do. Obamacare mandated that you have to live under one roof, and many states had similar requirements for doctors and hospitals, a mixture of the federal “cost-sharing payments” (Shout Out), the state-run health insurance exchange (Price Chopper), and paid out-of-pocket costs for procedures.\nConsumers considered almost half of its price charged directly by their doctor and hospital. They were shocked to discover how many were actually forced to pay into their insurance pocket. So, what, then, can a consumer expect to receive during a transition year?\nBut what’s not to like? Insurers are supposed to provide payment to health care providers and hospitals, which then get less of a subsidy to pay out of pocket to the patients who need care. So it’s the state that can use its “cost-sharing” payments as incentive for people to enroll in an unmet need.\nThis effort even gets easier when you compare how much you pay to how many other people pay. Yes, people may be responsible for those costs, but it could have been more expensive for them to have health insurance than for their families.\nWhile reforms were at work, the fundamental question was how much subsidies would help pay for people who desperately needed help getting health insurance. What was the maximum cap? Who gave it to? What the cost of the subsidies would be under any scenario of rapid changes in the way subsidies are regulated.\nYet, instead of offering Americans on or off Medicare a subsidy to offset their premiums, the Administration took Obamacare’s cost-sharing payment obligation and combined it with those additional subsidies. Over the next decade, without knowing exactly how much of the actual cost of health care is paid to insurance providers, you’d be hard pressed to say the cap was simply a way to get some kind of economic benefit out of it.\nThe House of Representatives considered legislation that would have penalized insurers, along with providers, and designed a “push out” scheme in which they might try to put people off receiving health insurance for their health insurance. The bill died in the Senate, but the economic figures on that legislation aren’t much better — at least for now.\nObamacare probably wouldn’t be fooling anybody again, but the falsehood that it is the antithesis of what’s needed by today’s economy is far more potent today than it was two decades ago. So the public, including policymakers, are just now beginning to understand what it would take to change the way insurance and insurance policies are sold and under how much subsidies are required and paid.\nThe American people didn’t vote for Trumpcare because they were so scared that they would be turned off by a health care system that’s riddled with complexity and health care officials that are using Obamacare-designed premiums and payments to punish people for their incompetence. And they didn’t vote for a Republican to put in place an end to Obamacare’s crushing hold on jobs and investment. They did vote for Trump and asked him to end it, but there is another way: they now know exactly how many people a mandate really helps.\n']"

We’re waiting to see what the outcome of that will be in the future,” Ducey explained.\nAlthough EBCA isn’t providing specific numbers, the ED is hoping to assist in meeting a number of critical needs in Jolo, such as basic essential healthcare, nutrition and housing, said Dorsey.\n“We know that people live in towns and counties where measles or influenza can spread or may occur and they probably live in the way counties where there is a sense of imminent danger for [them],” Dorsey said.\nIn addition to the two CDC funds, EBCA is doing close to $170,000 to bring the program to a close, with several hundred administrative and financial staff working to make sure the ED program reaches its current goal of providing affordable vaccinations and other services for families with chronic diseases, the head of EBCA’s Treatment Advocacy Department, identified.\n“The non-profit and non-business business insurance program we continue to prioritize needs for going forward. It’s just not gonna happen and we just need more funding,” Dorsey said.\nHe noted that the number of children and adults who are immunized, including those with severe or terminal diseases, has increased significantly over the past several years. “People can get general vaccination and about 350 now,” he said.\nHowever, the number of vaccines vaccines are still inadequate, said Dorsey.\n“Right now, about 90 to 95 percent of the diseases we’re seeing are mild to moderate,” Dorsey said. But the disease is becoming more widespread and diseases with high potential are becoming more serious.\n“We are seeing three or four times the number of adverse events in one year compared to one year just three years ago. That could have led to a lot of a complex problem,” Dorsey said.\nTo try to keep those diseases under control, EBCA is holding an informational meeting to try to track down and contact people affected by contracting pneumococcal and other diseases.\n']"

And as terrorist threats grow, nuclear weapons are also a national concern, too.\nVeterans stress their great fear of nuclear war, especially among soldiers.\n""Young, old, single, women, and those seeking stability are dying unnecessarily in the United States,"" they say. The report cites national security worries about “cooperation in response to rapid proliferation of nuclear weapons.""\nBut how are we going to manage the risk of a repeat?\nAnother big problem is the proliferation of nation states.

Less than a decade from now, after the first of these massive changes, many researchers say our power to prevent and deal with threats on a global scale could be in jeopardy.\n""Unless we make a shift toward a strategic nuclear force, every nation that faces this threat either has to switch away from attack on state or client states to foreign states,"" the report says. ""Our military needs to be prepared to do all it can to deal with threats from outside.""\nThe report also asks: Is this reality?\nOf course, never trust a nation state, that they can\'t easily cover future, big-time threats by acquiring equipment and capabilities.\nBut, the Pentagon says, ""we also need to be sure that America has enough of a secure and well-functioning homeland for a coordinated response from the armed forces, state and local authorities, and beyond.""\nAnd it urges stronger national-security coordination.

It doesn’t designate another individual to become an officer, nor does it call for him to be assigned to active duty.\nFusus Mattis, who heads the National Security Council, appointed the seven reservists on Friday, signed on by President Trump, and issued the call-up orders on behalf of Trump, Mattis said in a statement.\nThe order signed by Mattis cites the health and housing crises of recent years as a threat to nuclear security in the Middle East and the United States’ biggest problem, as well as terrorism and ballistic missile defense.\nThe threat began earlier this week when an attack on U.S. soil from Iran’s forces took place, and have seen increasing tensions between the U.S. and Iranian government throughout the Middle East.\nMattis said the U.S. was prepared for a potential attack.\n“There are immediate threats such as land reclamation of the Iran Strait, closure of the Strait of Hormuz and continued human rights violations on the Korean Peninsula and Sudan,” he said.\nNational security officials have repeatedly warned against an Islamic State-inspired attack in the U.S. homeland and urged against North Korea.\n']"

However it noted that this would be “without prejudice” for women, and favoured that women have the right to vote in the EU constitution as a woman.\n“We thought it was very positive,” Katherine Mitchell, policy director for the Irish Greens said. “Some of our policy advisers had brought up the need for the Paris climate agreement, and there are now repeated claims of environmental problems that have got closer to it. It also required that the Irish offer a means of recognition of women’s rights in the EU constitution.”\nThe other proposals include a draft law on gendered conduct at work and better professional recognition for women at work.

But the situation is especially difficult given the giant Spanish flu virus that has infected nearly 30,000 people in the U.S. since March.\n“I think we’re going to have to stand down a lot of the contingency resources that we have,” Shinseki said at the conference. “And we know that means the flu will be coming along very, very well —and there’s plenty of little, far-out containment options that we have.”\nAIG serves as the U.S. policy maker for the fund. The VA has spent roughly $US2 billion on the fund, Shinseki said.\nDuring a telephone interview, Shinseki said the fund was determined with the discovery of avian flu in Puerto Rico.\n""It was a massive incident,"" Shinseki said.\nAsked about some of the more recent outbreaks, Shinseki said the fund was building up security, testing equipment, routine cleaning, and that it has “trained about a thousand people.”\n“There’s more than 200 sick people, 10,000 people out there who need better care and have a greater capacity to take care of us,” Shinseki said.\nAsked whether he would have made the decision to deploy thousands of workers, Shinseki said, “I have to really be worried about Ebola, because it has taken this long to confirm this stuff. And if we could have, it would have started a long time ago.”\nA spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services said the agency had been monitoring the flu outbreak for an undisclosed period of time and looked for reports that it contained a virologist, certified infectious disease specialist, or SCIM, and wanted to take samples to confirm they had been infected.\nThe department also contracted a Swiss swine flu expert to conduct tests that conducted hundreds of clinics across the country. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has declared swine flu a potential public health threat to the public and has appealed for help from the public.\nUnlike the FDA, who launched testing for the flu more than a year ago, the VA’s Medical Center — which houses part of the outbreak in Puerto Rico — is only receiving pre-screened human tests.\nA VA spokesman said in a prepared statement the office is “taking every precaution possible to ensure that all personnel are treated with the appropriate care.” The statement went on to explain that “Vets should have no access to untreated wounds on the inpatients with acute diseases.”\n']"
559,‘Confusion and anxiety’ at Pentagon over telework guidance,"['WASHINGTON — A Pentagon panel of senior government officials announced on Tuesday that it plans to propose having all federal employees on the same telework “rules” when Congress delays on a bill that would make the government more transparent, including requiring aides to be briefed on incoming satellites and remote scientists, an announcement that was accompanied by a denunciation of the rule as a political ploy.\nThe Pentagon and senior executives of the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents key suppliers of satellites for unmanned systems, said the Pentagon would be laying out its proposal next week in a consultation with industry leaders and lawmakers.\nSenior levels of the U.S. government have been seriously divided about how to handle the National Science Foundation Foundation’s controversial directive that has shrunk from telework rules to requirements that non-inclusive personnel standards in the next round of budget negotiations are not being met in talks on next year’s budget.\nThe Aerospace Industries Association is concerned that changes to the administration’s overall budget would hurt the science community and cost jobs in government.\nAnd the coalition warned of possible “anxiety and fear” among contractors, who would probably fear better government oversight and fewer federal employees would seek outside counsel.\nThe Council of Federal Contractors (CFFC) said it plans to vote on a request for guidelines early next week. The idea is to provide at least basic network security and other information to contractors that could fall into the category of “experts with prescriptive agenda settings.”\n“This is too early to draft an opinion before our committee starts our preliminary hearing,” the CFFC said in a news release. “This is not fair, transparent and will be characterized as political by USIT [the Association of American Universities].”\nCritics of the practice, known as telework, are angry it would be taking place on college campuses.\n“Anytime they are really going to have a talk with their students about what is relevant in their social life, what is important in their work, how to motivate their work and what is important in their life is going to be harder than meeting with CFFC members if they’re not going to be talking,” said Alan Skurlick, who heads the Association of American Universities’ lobby group.\n“The fact of the matter is it was politicized because it [telework] is going to focus a lot of attention on professionals working in the government space. The lobbyist needs to know this was going to be a major, major public policy issue.”\nThe Aerospace Industries Association was trying to keep its proposal quiet until the public is aware of the details of the framework. The group explained at its recent meeting that it had collaborated on several voluntary guidelines for the Procurement Law Office, or PHLO, committee that is conducting a round of hearings on the rule.\nThe PHLO committee is set to convene in June to look at the best practices for the industry in the rules for the combined network security, air navigation and space safety areas.\nAfter the hearing, Logix, a Congress-friendly industry group, planned to hold a rally in Washington.\n“We’re only just moving forward,” Eqatri Rifi, CEO of the firm contracted to build satellite communications services for the Defense Department, told a congressional task force last week. “We are prepared to continue the pace.”\n[email protected]\n']"
560,Trump’s wobbly coronavirus response leaves Pentagon playing catch-up,"['By Megan Mcardle and Jeffrey Heller\nWASHINGTON, March 30 (Reuters) - The flu-like illness that caused so many civilian casualties last year, including two fatal ones, is still raging at the Pentagon, according to a report from the Pentagon on Thursday that calls into question the U.S. strategy to combat the virus and the U.S. taxpayer\'s decision to pay $108 million to modify robots at its air base.\nThe ongoing threats to the Navy\'s 1st Fleet in Hawaii are fueling concern among the Pentagon\'s top leaders that their men and women have lost the battle. Pentagon officials voiced concern about the outbreak, saying the virus had threatened to take over Hawaii in recent days.\n""We are going to have to know how bad this infection really is when it arrives and whether it is going to cause substantial damage,"" Admiral David Hill, commander of the 7th Fleet, said in an interview with reporters.\nHill said the outbreak was not worse than the previous wave of the flu, which was sustained in mid-January and was the third deadliest on U.S. soil.\n""After it came off, with the amount of infective activity, we were sort of in a tizzy,"" he said.\nBut such incidents were held up as part of the Pentagon\'s strategy to contain the virus at its base near Hawaii. A survey released last month showed that only 48 percent of enlisted sailors and Marines responded to a recent questionnaire asking whether they expected to return home in the next seven years. That number dropped to 58 percent when sailors who returned agreed to be tested next year.\nOfficials said they had no information at the height of the flu outbreak that began on Jan. 1 and the new one last month had raised fears that the new infections could cause some of the nation\'s older sailors to experience pneumonia.\nVeterinarians said the Navy did not have reliable statistics on where they have seen a new strain of flu already in the air base but Dr. Kevin Humphreys, a team leader at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said it was likely to increase within a year if the new, more aggressive strain is detected.\nThe Pentagon report on Thursday said no one in the Army is mentioned in it, but that the missile services did include an expert witness on the outbreak as the chief health officer and chief clinical officer of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe Army said in February it had used data collected at the base to show its risk for serious illness at the drone wing of the Navy\'s Phoenix base.\nThe Navy disclosed a trend in recent months of suicide and the Navy\'s newest weapon, Buzzard, in a high-profile conflict-related incident last week, U.S. officials said.\nOfficials said a drug cocktail at Phoenix had failed to properly manage the battery blast, which injured at least seven soldiers and killed all eight.\nCosts associated with the fatal incident have added up over the years to $159 million, most of it spent on R&D, but far from being the health-related cost that they are today.\n""A lot of dollars, quite honestly, have gone to work on the disease,"" said Ashley Cane of the Department of Defense Patient Diagnostics. ""The suppliers of the [Pentagon]-provided drugs have not been happy about it. They have instead been pushing the budget agenda.""\nACID WITH POTENTIAL HOSPITALITY\nThe Pentagon says the effort to fight the flu grew out of a request that Congress granted in 2006 to integrate the Phoenix and Caney missile wing, where major damage occurred during a war zone.\nThe coalition received ""overwhelming support"" from Congress for the so-called ""combat avoidance"" strategy, the Pentagon\'s U.S. Combatant Command said in its report. The request included an update to the U.S. military ""to not have to repeat decades of mistakes in the response to a combat deployment"" where equipment and personnel were badly damaged, the report said.\nIt also included demands that the air base\'s air defense system get better equipment, a counter-computer program that will be operational by the end of 2020.\nThe Navy said in the new report that it had a contracting problem to deal with how to identify and respond to all the potential outbreaks in the air base in the coming year, with mixed results.\n""We have a backlog of questions,"" Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson said. ""What the challenges are? How do we communicate the message to our troops?""\nThe report, which comes just days after a highly classified first batch of internal Navy budget documents and reinforces lawmakers\' concerns, expressed growing concern about the outbreak.\nAnd last month, the Pentagon\'s climate change report says the threat to civilian life is increasing over the years and is causing serious environmental damage around the world.\n']"

Rawlings are contemplating about double the number of active duty National Guard troops and veterans, a shift in military planning that is requiring trimming billions of dollars a year.\nThe National Guard total is expected to jump to nearly 10,000 by late April, a senior administration official said Tuesday, after Rachael Rettig\'s top aide, Adrian Conroy, waded into the debate to discuss the Army\'s new B-52 bomber replacement and how the action reflects changing demographics and military goals.\n""There\'s a systematic effort to get out troops, and the Army today is replacing some of those missing troops,"" said one former Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions are private.\nThe total -- and not new -- numbers on the Army\'s combat training and support service won\'t be known until the first quarter of next year, though the numbers would count as part of the 2017 B-52 replacement order.\nThe new growth comes amid a much-needed effort by the Pentagon and Congress to ensure enough troops can support a combat brigade that offers more than 90,000 combat troops and 5,000 artillery or armor-piercing munitions to non-combat troops who don\'t have to pursue basic combat missions.\nCongress, with spending growth outpacing population growth to the tune of the last 40 years, is seeking new funding and putting the 15,500-strong Army reserves in place at the request of the White House. The talks have so far been fruitless, and the Obama administration could sell the B-52 to Congress without politically damaging its replacement.\nCongress approved a two-year moratorium on cuts to Pentagon construction plans, but the Commerce Department soon voted in favor of a measure, overwhelmingly approved by a GOP-dominated House, to remove a provision that would have cut spending for the B-52 replacement by half.\nRawlings is seeking more than two-thirds of the funds necessary to speed construction work and to assist the transition to new B-52s. Pentagon plans call for rebuilding roughly 100,000 trees within 23 weeks of a hit to the Army\'s services trees, according to prepared statements from Rawlings.\nHer top advisor, Gen. Michael Flynn, has said: ""We\'re going to accelerate getting our soldiers trained ... and getting our base management teams ready to take over the missions.""\nRawlings said in last week\'s story in The Washington Post that the Senate needs to approve a better-designed $17 billion plan for the Army to reinforce the new B-52, a figure she repeated Tuesday.\nA white paper by Rawlings\' office issued Tuesday included a proposed all-inclusive costs measure, meaning that the $9 billion in savings would be used instead of reimbursing employees for costs of moving their bases.\nThe buildup of troops and Marines could continue until 2020, even as talks in Congress continue on how to pay for retiree health care.\nAlso Tuesday, the Obama administration released the first draft of a new five-year, $650 billion plan to boost the Army\'s forward operating combat forces and combat readiness. The White House has previously advocated beefing up the force by 2027 -- with an initial 60,000 troops and armed forces while the Pentagon refines the Army\'s older, divided infantry and armor units.\nThe exercise at the heart of the plan is a one-year commitment to this month\'s Iraq and Afghanistan training mission, which includes the use of fighting skills, infantry school education and other challenges, the White House said.\n']"

The Kurds, who have been fighting Islamic State and other forces since 2006, control large parts of northern Syria.\n“We are deeply concerned by reports that Iraqi and Syrian officials might attack our country using a military offensive and using a desperate attempt to interfere with the upcoming G-20,” the Pentagon said in a statement Wednesday.\nThe attacks were likely timed to coincide with Arab efforts to implement a deal that began under former U.S. President Barack Obama in 2013. Obama canceled the initiative after saying that international inspectors found violations in the World Trade Organization. After Russia backed off, which the Obama administration negotiated, Secretary of State John Kerry scrapped it.\n']"

This grade school is not exactly magical anymore.\nAs long as there are crutches, telephones, and plastic-bag disposables for every adolescent, the film feels like a good antidote to the gut wrenching dramas of the ’70s.\nMore Reviews Film Review: 'Making a Murderer' TV Review: Netflix's 'Wake Up Call Me Maybe'\nAnd the humor makes for good references. One of the best lines of the film is that it is good that those used “good things” are better than “bad things.”\n“Non Bigotry” is effectively a massive moral piece if you take the framework away from the beauty of the film and conclude that religion — no religion — not catharsis — nor the force of just passion — in the race to space and to space itself — is really a consequence of how some of the drama is presented.\nBut how much is beyond me when that freedom isn’t unlimited and this fine film — made mostly with only a few exceptions — is opened up to everybody from Hollywood to non-movie-making types, the Spaniards, Syrians, the Jewishs, Russians, Greeks, Taiwanese, Mexicans, Saudis, hairdressers and the novelties of the Catholic Church.\nIt’s still disappointing to witness this video-on-demand quasi-mockumentary as a whole.\n“Non Bigotry” is part of a long playing of final mustaches that might never be heard. That it takes so long to like someone’s transcendent performances for everyone to see is utterly unsatisfying.\n""]"

It requires a four-year strategy, followed by a seven-year plan and no changes until 2024.\nWhen an infectious disease begins, it can spread into a person’s bloodstream and organs, or is contracted at birth through infection by direct contact with the body’s environment, such as air, water or surface surfaces.\nOfficials are examining how many personnel would be deployed but little else is known about the population or geographic location of the thousands of people who probably contracted H3N2. Federal law requires that the placement of troop units be coordinated within the United States and EU.\n“We are absolutely prepared to take on these challenging challenges, but the federal government will do whatever it takes to ensure that this never happens again,” Trump said in his statement to the summit.\nThe White House immediately responded to the proposal, a move advanced by Trump’s office with quick comment, on Twitter, saying: “Let’s see how much more developed an ability to combat these deadly viruses is quickly.”\nThe countries and organizations involved in the V3 epidemic are concerned that the White House proposal — which was unanimously approved by the White House Council on Environmental Quality, a group of 15 nations among which includes Iran — would unnecessarily stigmatize the virus. Many countries have a voracious appetite for HIV because of their deep commitment to combating HIV-related diseases, and experts have noted that H3N2, the world’s most common case of confirmed transmission of a virus and the most deadly antiviral drug known to be used to treat AIDS, is believed to be the leading cause of death in the world.\n“This plan effectively decimates the effective outbreak of H3N2 because it will only go so far,” said Brad Schuman, a National Institutes of Health infectious disease expert who writes in The Lancet medical journal that this plan is misguided because it “ignores the true extent of the viral side effect of changing exposure to all those infectious agents in the atmosphere.”\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most common pathogen with the highest prevalence of viral transmission is the avian flu virus, which is transmitted through human contact. The most common virus in the United States is the H1N1 vaccine, which was approved in 2012 by the Food and Drug Administration. The Department of Health and Human Services previously suggested deploying American troops for similar duties in Europe, with the more-populated territories spread in.\nNorth Africa\nHowever, the plan for deployment in the Americas may not be complete.

""The bacterium can survive under the yoke of haematologic assay without getting infective.""\nThe DoD did not appear to have any cases of hepatitis C diagnosed in its lab, despite security lapses for the first time. Part of the problem is the department took up more money for supplies for duty stations that are supposed to be properly equipped in Canada. It\'s unclear whether or not the Legionella outbreak took a toll on the importance of the test — but if it did, employees who potentially tested positive could get away with it because the CDC doesn\'t make an official recommendation to cover the risk, said Dr. Dong-Roh.\n""This is not affecting the intent of the hiring process, and the safety of our process is an issue,"" said Dr. Lee Duguay, assistant secretary for enforcement. ""Those employees are employees, but don\'t have direct employment with the department.""\nDr. Chang-Mong wants the department to quickly launch an internal health care plan to deal with the outbreak.\n""We need to fast-track, assess and assign appropriate resources to our laboratories to ensure timely deliveries of influenza and AIDS vaccines,"" he said.\nThe DoD has put a plan in place to replace and expedite dozens of employees who missed a full month when they left on May 31 last year to begin preparing for tests. Most won\'t be back to work until August.\nDoD staff is on alert for a repeat of the pandemic — other illnesses have since spread but caused no public health problems, said Dr. Chang-Mong.\n""I wish we could call them off the AIDS virus, but a lot of people don\'t want to,"" he said.

So how do we identify and treat the silent ailment that affects 71 million Americans?\nThe coronavirus — often called an anthrax virus — is spreading at a rapid pace in far more geographic locations than it is in the U.S. And it\'s not getting any easier to prevent.\nA spokeswoman for the air force\'s International Air Service\nThe virus is already spreading to more dangerous areas in Europe. The United States, Britain and Australia have all seen a 100 percent reduction in the number of cases reported, although that can be reduced with vaccination. Instead, the more specialized specialists have been paid for to go in and take care of the sick and dying, which means smaller-scale infections, like the most deadly coronavirus known.\nOfficials estimate that half of all anthrax cases between 2003 and 2014 ended in deaths. We also weren\'t immune when the subvirus spread through the U.S. between 2009 and 2013.

""We don\'t try anything new on this.""\nIndeed, the diagnostics in an epidemiological survey conducted for earlier this year by The National Institute on Drug Abuse noted that people looking to vaccinate against a contagious respiratory virus or vaccine are more susceptible to the disease.\nSince dengue fever is endemic in Afghanistan, the pathogenesis of this relatively rare coronavirus is a macular degeneration, or glaucoma, which is a hereditary condition that has not been seen in many nations. Though only a small percentage of the cases have been reported in the U.S., the huge number of cases is all attributable to the recent outbreak of dengue fever.\nDespite dengue fever at home and abroad, fatalities have occurred at a rapid pace in very remote parts of North and South America.\nHere\'s why you can\'t just call it a coronavirus epidemic.\n']"

Steven Gellot, a Pentagon spokesman.\nThe military, which is supervised by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), covers the bases of more than 1,300 military bases around the world, and is responsible for the transportation of both aid workers and first responders from war zones to medical facilities.\nThe focus of these operations is preventing the spread of the Ebola virus, especially in countries without mines and contaminated water that are linked to the virus, according to the commander of an additional 500-plus military personnel in Liberia.\nThe second American flight to a West African country in six days was canceled.\nA total of 90 planes, submarines, aircraft carriers and tactical aircraft and ground troops had arrived in Liberia to monitor the health of the suspect that had been detained there, Oceana said on its website.\nA U.S. Department of Defense official said earlier on Tuesday that the Christian agency that oversees Sierra Leone was close to being able to provide an immediate medical evacuation order.\nThe agency was concerned that as many as 200,000 more West Africans, many of them African immigrants, might have been at risk and wanted to avoid contagion in their homeland.\nThe patient was treated at a San Diego hospital for Ebola, said Nick Arneson, an epidemiologist at San Diego State University.\nHe expressed disappointment that other officials had not directed their medics to look for Ebola cases elsewhere.\n“I don’t necessarily think it’s a public health hazard but I do think it’s a very, very public concern for the public,” Arneson said.\n']"
568,White House holding up DoD nomination amid Trump loyalty purge,"['By Reuters\nThe White House is holding a series of meetings to try to reach a unanimous support, with the Democratic Senator to join forces with Republicans for a vote on a formal nomination of Secretary of Defense James Mattis.\nThe White House issued a statement saying Mattis would oppose Trump\'s nomination, to replace retired General James Jones as secretary of the Navy. But Sessions expressed reservations about Mattis.\n""It seems widely accepted that if confirmed, Jones would have the same responsibilities as Secretary Mattis, who did so on a political level,"" Sessions said in the statement.\nYahoo News reported this month that Sessions wanted to reject Trump\'s October confirmation to the top job as attorney general, a vote that Republicans thought they could filibuster. Sessions is still not clear to stand against Trump in Senate confirmation hearings and faces one late Wednesday.\nIn a letter to Mattis, Sessions said the nomination was ""rejected in committee on a face-to-face basis by the Senate leadership, but for reasons I have yet to be made clear"" to him.\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders also faced a pushback from Sessions.\n""Secretary Mattis and his department deserve the respect and consideration they deserve. We demand that they vigorously oppose this action as Sen. Sessions is already doing against the nominee,"" Sanders said.\nSenate Republicans last month voted to accept Cohen\'s motion to question Trump about his ties to the Russia probe. Cohen\'s Senate confirmation hearing is scheduled for Thursday, with Sessions and all other Trump allies potentially facing a challenge to their nomination.\nIf passed, the Senate defense committee committee would hold a hearing later, presumably on the nomination of Jones, while the Senate Finance Committee will vote on Mattis\' nomination. Sessions is being considered for his second stint as attorney general.\nDemocrats are playing off the potential for Trump to take advantage of Sessions\' refusal.\nTrump has called Mueller\'s probe a witch hunt and has already shown he could seek accountability from others for his actions before an investigation is launched. The Justice Department released a statement in support of both Republicans and Democrats during last week\'s Senate hearing in which they asked Trump to appoint a special counsel.\nSchumer announced a resolution asking Trump to nominate Jones for the vacant defense post, which is being vacated by Mattis\' departure and would be effective on May 17. If confirmed, Jones would replace Jones in that post.\nTrump also has appointed Sessions\' son Michael, as interior secretary, as a special counsel under a Trump-era policy to be brought up when he is seeking the White House. The transition team had sought Sessions\' former senior aide, Rep. Steve Cohen, for a chance to bring up Sessions for another hearing during an April 14 hearing, but Cohen had quietly moved his paperwork.\nCohen said on Friday he was disappointed that Trump kept on claiming that he was going to decide on Jones\'s nomination at the end of last week. ""If it is true, as secretary, Jones would absolutely deserve to be confirmed,"" Cohen said in a statement.\n___\nAssociated Press Writer Michael Balsamo contributed to this report.\n']"
569,U.S. boosts forces in Middle East as Iran situation reignites,"['BEIRUT — The U.S. stepped up its forces in Syria on Monday as President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from an international accord on Tehran’s nuclear program.\nIn a departure from U.S. policy last month, Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, offered up a “substantial” commitment to Syrian President Bashar Assad and pledged an immediate end to the Iranian nuclear accord that expired last month. That was in response to the killing of an Iranian activist, including the alleged perpetrator, at an election rally in Iran, the New York Times reported.\nBolton said the U.S. would continue discussions with the Iranians on a way to cease interference in Syria, now the country’s largest political prize. The White House said Iran was given a more “cordial, agreeable, and polite” response.\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said Trump’s decision to withdraw would result in “widespread acceptance and decision-making within Syria”. His departure, which is a disappointment to many other allies in the Arab world, gives more urgency to the U.S. mission in Syria and Egypt’s presence in neighboring Yemen.\nPresident Trump’s decision was a major setback to the Iran nuclear accord, and he withdrew the U.S. from the same deal during his first term. However, the Iranian nuclear deal that wrapped up in 2012 required the U.S. to grant, according to the White House, a nuclear freeze. Trump’s decision in February asked Congress to approve a continuing resolution by April 16, as the latest deadline for signing is May 1.\nBolton called for a more “vibrant engagement” with Iran and its ally Syria’s government. He voiced optimism that both the international community and Tehran would recognize that the dispute over Iran’s nuclear program had been settled.\n“It’s different than in the past,” Bolton said. “There are still people in the international community who don’t fully understand the impact of what is happening in Iran on the Middle East, on the Syrian people and the refugees that are here.”\nThe Syrian Republican Guard, known as the People’s Protection Units, or YPA, said its fighting force would remain in Syria, but say it would “continue” fighting against the Islamic State group. Hezbollah, the Islamic State group, a powerful Lebanese terrorist group, backed the Assad government.\nThe PUS said it would move forward with their efforts to defeat Islamic State in Syria and in Iraq.\nIranian officials said the PUS had concluded two ceasefires with Iraqi forces following a brief stay at the truce stand. It said there were more violations there than would have occurred if Iranian forces had the opportunity to use the ceasefires.\nThe long-running dispute over Iranian nuclear aims in the Middle East began in 2008, and there was never enough time to complete a temporary, international nuclear deal. Iranian officials wanted the implementation of the accord — through sanctions relief — in line with international economic pressure. The U.S. initially supported the accord, but became the only one to back it, so there was no need for negotiating.\nExperts say the success of the agreement was hampered by Iran’s decade-long support for Syrian President Bashar Assad, whom the U.S. regarded as a fundamental threat. However, the U.S. hopes to get an exit from the pact, which does not cover Iran’s nuclear program, at some point in the future.\nBolton called for Iran to immediately cease hostilities against Israel, Syria and Iraq.\nThe U.S. withdrawal included about 4,500 American troops from Iraq, a move Bolton said the U.S. would continue to consider “for now” but not for the immediate future.\n']"
570,Pentagon asks to reconsider massive cloud contract award amid Amazon challenge,"['SACRAMENTO — The Pentagon on Thursday asked the Bush administration to reconsider an award to a massive cloud computing service provider because it was uncertain whether it would violate other Pentagon contracts and could potentially be sued by Amazon.\nThe Pentagon made the request in a letter dated Monday, which was included in a government transparency release. It asks that the department reconsider the award and review the awarding of the contract.\nThe contract was worth about $160 million, according to the Department of Defense. The contract was created by Congress during the Obama administration to support the Pentagon’s cloud computing effort. After the deal failed, hundreds of groups sought to secure $2 billion in private-sector help to roll out the military’s broad cloud infrastructure.\nThe Pentagon argued that the fund would not amount to money and that the government has suffered administrative losses because of oversupply caused by the tech investments. The Pentagon said it had been sued for violating confidentiality agreements with Amazon.\nThe Pentagon contacted Microsoft and other cloud providers in a letter responding to the company’s request.\nThat request prompted the Deloitte Consulting firm to investigate whether “it could be a probable use of public procurement funds for management of government-owned cloud assets.” The company checked with Deloitte for answers to questions about benefits associated with public procurement.\nThe information comes weeks after Microsoft issued a court filing saying it plans to pay up to $8 billion over 10 years to resolve allegations from the Washington Post and others that the company has used government IT resources to underwrite its own cloud efforts.\n']"

The group does not have a militia group in Iraq, but also there is the city of Sinjar and has now been fighting the militants for the last two years.\n“State-sponsored terrorist groups or organizations created by their leaders, or have perpetrated targeted violence against innocents, remain engaged in the creation and implementation of terrorist groups, including with or without the presence of the Islamic State,” the report said.\nThe Iraqi government said it did not use the report to draw specific conclusions, but its defense chief Maj. Gen. Michael Krueger said the review of the report would ensure it was thorough and comprehensive and should be final by next week.\n“We are not done,” he said at a news conference in Baghdad. “We will be communicating more to clarify what is driving this.”\nU.S. military officials have said the United States will not pull out any more U.S. troops in Iraq.\nKrueger said U.S. forces would continue to work with Iraqi officials to achieve a ceasefire between the government and the Islamic State, and maintain the rights of civilians to their homes.\nAn estimated 100,000 Iraqis have become refugees over the past two years as a result of the U.S.-led military campaign to end a five-year-old civil war in the Sunni Arab state.\n']"

But a blow to the organization would not likely be enough to stop it, Rice said.\nThe rocket attack was directed at Samheld Air Base and Sampled near northeast Syria, Rice said. There were no casualties, he said.\nOther airstrikes targeted a missile base in the rebel-held Idlib province, a rebel commander said Wednesday, and Syrian troops clashed with militants seeking a temporary cease-fire in the Homs province in the past two days.

Despite that, thanks to the fact that the first findings from the job of investigating the coronavirus have yet to be made public, it is possible that this working method could play a role in the building of a new species of coronavirus that will serve as a template for other coronavirus scientists using modern tools on the fly around the world.\nIn Canada, the Boreal Conservation Environment team was part of NASA’s expedition this week, and the Office of Naval Research is involved in establishing a highly visible marker of the coronavirus that will be released early next week. NASA’s instrument sets up an image-reading device that was launched in 1983 and recorded on the B5A Hercules spacecraft back in September 2001. As with the B5A, the image-reading device will be displayed at various intervals throughout the region. To study the planet around it, NASA’s Pacific Northwest Technical High Capability Unit (PHPU) will also be at the event.\nBesides looking for an active coronavirus in the tropics, the U.S. has been looking for a specific coronavirus reservoir that could be an indicator of a common human case of a coronavirus. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, coronavirus is a common mosquito with leech-like properties that can travel through tropical or southern seaboard waters and spread the virus to humans and animals.\nHowever, the coronavirus doesn’t come with any warning labels, and the instruments that will attempt to interpret the information from the Mapper-tested photos in exchange for samples have only a small capacity to capture a small number of images.\nThe United States is also continuing its efforts to measure the potential level of coronavirus exposure that can spread to humans due to changes in the body structure and the coronavirus are known to evolve when bacterial bugs emerge. NASA’s event was a follow-up to its mission at McMurdo and is NASA’s third visit to Mapper in the last seven years. The flying practice segment will target microbes in the quill-processing process and assist in determining the level of immunity and the potential environmental impact of the evolving coronavirus.\n']"
581,Defense contractor charged with giving up military secrets,"['As it faced potential of similar charges from a former Navy contractor, the defense contractor behind one of North Korea’s most notorious supply lines to Asia has been set to go to trial for allegedly providing financial aid to Kim Jong Un’s regime.\nThe United States filed criminal charges against Douglas Tharp, a contractor working with the Air Force in California, on Thursday in Seoul, which U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz acknowledged “what a long time ago had seemed possible and now seems now unlikely.”\nAccording to The Daily Caller, Tharp had been working as a consultant with Mediated States, a Kabul-based company that had dealings with North Korea. Tharp was also the nation’s biggest enlisted contractor, having worked at various Defense Department agencies.\n“If anything can be done in this country, I can assure you that this is an investigation,” Ortiz said of the civil charges against Tharp, who was arrested at a casino in the United States early last month.\nThe rest of the charges have yet to be determined, but Ortiz said she believes the charges stem from the company’s involvement in “major, complex, high-profile” foreign-policy issues, like North Korea’s nuclear program and military capabilities.\nScrap of Trump: A 19th-Century Fox Star Picks Trump vs. Kim\nUS Attorney Ortiz used Tharp’s performance to find ways to blackmail the Obama administration, The Washington Post reported. In March, Trump took over as US president by promising to end a secret arms sale to North Korea, an agreement he said he had actively facilitated in exchange for stalling its nuclear program.\nTHarp’s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, declined to comment Thursday, the same day that his client’s lawyers requested permission to seek the impeachment of President Donald Trump by an impeachment panel in the House of Representatives.\n“I will say this now is an evolving legal framework to get us on a case that I can get right now,” Avenatti said.\nTharp was originally indicted on one count of wire fraud and one count of commercial fraud. When he took over Mediated States in March, he said his business partnership with Mediated States was to set up a contract to sell enriched uranium through Lockheed Martin.\nAt the time of the indictment, Republican lawmakers and other witnesses alleged that Tharp had helped organize a drugs unit for the Jong Nam murder.\nLawyers for the Air Force said they believed Tharp had started the murder investigation.\nICE Deputy Director for Security and Intelligence in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Dennis Ross, said Tharp did not cooperate in the investigation and he would not comment until a hearing on the charges was held.\n“The government’s investigation of the various incidents involving Douglas Tharp … focused only on the pharmaceutical program,” Ross said in a statement. “The government takes very seriously all matters that may arise from this investigation and will seek to conduct it in a thorough and credible manner.”\n']"

Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who said he was distressed by the president’s plans.\n“Despite a recent review of our participation in Afghanistan, and a more realistic assessment of our commitment to do so, we remain convinced that at a minimum we should withdraw our troops from Afghanistan first so we can still meet the international goals,” said Graham.\nGraham, a former Navy SEAL who served in Iraq, expressed “unconvinced” the withdrawal would be complete if U.S. forces continued to assist Iraq.\n']"

The bill, which also contained more than a dozen changes, passed on a 59-32 vote, a few hours before midnight.\nThe vote is a crucial step toward getting most of the economy back on track and avoiding the government shutdown in coming weeks.\nMajor Senate Republicans are continuing to work on the package, even as they face pressure from business interests to vote against the bill.\nThe budget deal, which included an infrastructure bill, increasing the U.S. trade deficit and increased consumer spending, was hailed as a victory for small businesses, farmers and other taxpayers.\nBut as Republicans began pushing ahead with key parts of the legislation, it was warned that the rules still needed to be changed before passage and how the measure would be implemented.\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the legislation ultimately ""can\'t be improved simply because of partisan politics.""\nThe vote was particularly critical to Democrats, who saw themselves as backers of a pro-business tax cut and infrastructure bill without credit for the infrastructure package.\nThey also appear to be pressing ahead with the budget bill for the final deadline, but concerns persist that some key provisions of the legislation could fall short of the required spending caps and delayed passage of that act, according to congressional aides.\nThe tax bill includes the biggest rollbacks in business tax rates since Reagan, but it also gives lawmakers more funding for the U.S. job training and education programs and help for small businesses. The bill also includes business tax cuts through 2025.\nDemocrats accused Republicans of trying to scare small businesses into voting for tax cuts for the rich and across party lines, which would hurt middle-class workers and lower incomes.\nMitch McConnell, the chairman of the Senate tax-writing committee, called the votes-for-cuts act ""troubling,"" as he was leaving an event he was hosting with Democrats and Republicans, and asked House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to explain his remarks.\n""I think people were hoping that this is going to be done and we\'re not getting it done,"" McConnell said. ""We\'re seeing the price we have to pay to keep everyone from potentially being taxed more.

585,‘Just damage containment’: Cost of the coronavirus shutdown keeps rising,"['× ‘Just damage containment’: Cost of the coronavirus shutdown keeps rising\nWASHINGTON, D.C. — Since coronavirus traces began filtering into the U.S. in February, additional funds and equipment have been cut off.\n“The government is now in the deep freeze, and even if that happens, this entire burden won’t come to the rescue until later in the week,” Rep. Scott Taylor (R-Va.) told CNN Wednesday on CNN’s “State of the Union.”\nThe cost to the American public of the forthcoming coronavirus season has reached more than $20 million. Routine treatment, disposing of the virus and cleaning up after the disease, is expected to run out of funding this month.\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meanwhile, is running out of money to keep taxpayers and patients from paying for medical procedures that prevent the infection, including drugs.\nMultiple governmental agencies are responding to the outbreak, including the CDC and the FBI. The Blade reported Wednesday the agencies’ response “from the CDC is another dagger to the heart of the modern age of privacy.”\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration will be forced to allocate a $48 million grant as part of the public health emergency, said CDC Director Tom Frieden.\nHospitals and emergency rooms in the United States are being asked to clean up only a portion of the virus.\nDr. Jeffrey Haddad, director of the CDC’s Division of Infectious Diseases, says 60 percent of all cases of coronavirus have been reported in the country so far. By comparison, the death rate is a “far lower” 20 percent compared to the same time period in the 2000 to 2008 flu season.\nHalf of deaths were attributed to lead poisoning and half occurred in people who “had recently moved in the incubation period,” Haddad said.\nThe numbers reveal “the scale of the crisis and the burden of disease that is being caused by the enigma virus,” Haddad said. “This is not a virus in a vacuum. It’s coming from a dark cloud.”\nReleasing that number could give an incomplete picture of the risk of the virus spreading further, according to Dr. John Wilkerson, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.\nThe latest outbreak has killed at least 124 people and infected more than 4,000.\n']"
586,How the $2 trillion deal came together — and nearly fell apart,"['Around the same time, the White House scrambled with its A-team to gain a coalition of Democrats, GOP centrists, and President Trump’s hapless minions to agree on major changes to the tax plan. The deal went nowhere for many of the major stakeholders in the deal, yet that wasn’t the only thing that finally collapsed.\nAn agreement on revenue reduction a la Obamacare was pushed apart by the huge bill from the House, known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nThat tax deal included several big concessions from all of the non-GOP governors and their Congressional allies — Obama’s budget explicitly allocated any surplus from Obamacare subsidies to states with low-income populations, and Medicaid expansion expanded eligibility to the entire Medicaid cohort, as well as public health policy. Although it ultimately led to the expiration of Obamacare subsidies, that was all undone to create a new federal income tax, which became Obamacare’s most unpopular entitlement.\nThe big deal went away and, at the heart of this month’s negotiations, a big deal that was mostly described as the deal on taxes — with revenue as the No. 1 topic.\nThe easiest way to define that deal is because of its handful of unknowns, most of which might obscure much of its promise and, when an eventual agreement is reached, the action could lead to dramatic changes to the Trump presidency. That’s because President Trump could lift taxes to many of the same levels as the standard Democratic plan. In fact, the New York Times reported the following day that one of Trump’s top advisers met with lawmakers in the House of Representatives and Senate today to discuss the possibility of tax reform:\nMore than half of the private payroll tax cuts now proposed are indexed for inflation. Here’s what you should know: https://t.co/5ZI1NJgi3D — Tad Devine (@taddevine) March 31, 2019\nIf anything, the “big hit” to the insurance industry will probably hurt the government’s health-care budget, as anyone who’s been paying taxes on them can attest.\nIt’s also possible that Trump could dump the individual mandate, which prevented any tax cuts for some or all people, and extend the individual mandate to cover all but the wealthiest Americans. The only obvious solution is for the president to simply proclaim that he is willing to fund Obamacare, even in some broad-based measures like repealing the individual mandate.\nRegardless of what happens next, though, there’s no reason to think that the Republican Congress will struggle any more with tax reform than the Democrats or Obama did, and would need to redraw the tax code over time to change it.\n[Image: Lloyd Kopaloff/Vivid Entertainment]\n']"

More specifically, that’s because most of the people polled named Trump’s approach to immigrants—like recent proposals for restricting private member services—as what they believe to be a “hard” immigration system.\n“President Trump seems to want his party to agree on a strategy so they can go out and recruit more white evangelicals and other groups to come into our nation and stand up for this new law,” tweeted Karen Finley, a senior policy researcher at Pew and former White House press secretary.

588,The unthinkable: Is it time to shut down the stock market?,"['Imagine it now: the National Marketwatch website, with its seemingly endless stream of feedback since the mid 1990s on whether technology has the capacity to provide real-time solutions for a market that hasn’t been run successfully by a manual sales force, produces a list of recommendations for stocks that, if properly replaced, can give investors the opportunity to rediscover their pension plan investment basics. The site, which is part of a larger roundtable of investors, were founded in 2014 by Sheryl Sandberg, chief financial officer of Facebook, and Larry Page, the internet entrepreneur best known for founding Google with Silicon Valley’s help. When Sandberg and Page appeared before the 2010 Nobel Prize in medicine, shares of the software development company missed out on the subsequent rush of investor anticipation for next year’s winners that the market had already acknowledged.\nIt wasn’t even a surprise. Since the prediction was first made in early 2010, when Sandberg spoke with reporters in a Stanford interview after becoming Facebook’s chief executive, social media activists have become a veritable lightning rod for misinformation. Two weeks ago, just as Twitter was widely exposed for what many consider incontrovertible facts, Facebook made headlines for laying out all-caps personalized dossiers to help users decide which stock should not belong in the “hashtag market.” Then the company revealed a redesign of its stock market reporting tool earlier this week and updated its blog to set aside all user favorites to generate search results across-the-board. “A few of the stats that were presented last night were actually modest,” Facebook spokesperson Tim Rooke told TechCrunch. “We don’t have any graphs or statistics that would indicate exactly how many shares came to be ranked in the hash-tag market.”\nOf course, social-media ads have generally helped the real-world marketplace become much more transparent, and will most likely do the same for securities markets when the permanent bull market ends and values begin to stabilize. Nevertheless, one major concern remains, specifically the potential for over-regulation by an insular tech sector, as has played out before in many countries: poor stock market returns when stocks climb more quickly than appreciated markets.\nIndeed, the aforementioned book by Mark Mestas, where the headlines regularly cite poor stock markets, predates the financial crisis when consumer confidence collapsed due to a spike in defaults, allowing banks to snap up thousands of fragile investment assets, freeing up financial markets for investors to potentially buy stocks at inflated prices. After the 1987 crash, it was clear that the value of investing in securities was unsustainably low, and in July, Morgan Stanley’s most famous strategist, Bill Gross, made a basic remark about “today’s financial marketplace.”\n“We were told at the outset, but not until after the crash that the market was an overwhelmingly positive investment,” Gross wrote back in 2010. “Now we find the stocks are well over five times that amount.”\nThose were no small mistakes, and in particular the process that allowed Goldman Sachs to be acquired by JPMorgan in March 2011, forcing the firm to strike out on its own terms and leave its investors with the largest financial burden of investment-grade debt in history. Equities suffered a huge, though still-unrealistic, loss that Goldman failed to parlay into a new 7% ownership stake, erasing 70% of the firm’s global equity stake—albeit minus more than 4% due to conflict with MF Global. The financial crash also hit close to the tail end of the financial crisis, when a spate of market-related, cascading disclosures led the markets to experience a massive drop in valuations.\nSo it’s hard to tell what Zuckerberg sees when he sees a single Facebook stock “dubbed the Flipstchart.” But when he sees more accurate metrics and subsequent efficacy, it’s worth pointing out that it wouldn’t be a quick turnaround for Facebook to keep shrinking and moving market-watching and stock-weighted returns. (The Securities and Exchange Commission, in its much hyped SEC Volcker Rule proposal, recently recommended a broader reform that added disclosure requirements for players in the market and advanced the financial justice it requires of investor groups that stand to benefit from stock-market turbulence.)\nSome measure of market freedom would help, but such measures can’t trickle down to every investor. Whether or not Facebook attempts a similar process in the future, though, is another question altogether. Don’t expect the social media company to ignore major stock market indicators as they used to. But perhaps it will heed Zuckerberg’s warnings when he says so at the Met Gala ceremony on Monday.\n']"

Common symptoms include sneezing, burning lips and a build-up of mucus, which is an issue to detect early and well.\nSymptoms of respiratory contagion usually include coughing fits, fever, rapid breathlessness, muscle weakness, weakness, exhaustion, nausea, vomiting, and a range of other symptoms.\n""Nobody knows why some people become infected, but what we do know is there was an opportunity to get people on a plane at a different landing station and because there is a very, very contagious sickness, we would never know until those symptoms evolved into similar infection,"" said Mann.\n""They are contagious to individuals in the US,"" he continued. ""And then those who are sick in the US should be on a plane. If they get sick from their own inhalation, if they drink a liquid of some sort on the plane and could make a noise in the very first couple minutes or so of their flight, that person is exposed to a different environment and get sick.\n""You would be the first to say that just by a mental health issue,"" he said.\nThe respiratory viruses who cause this illness, which can include all types of respiratory conditions such as low-functioning cough, cold, and obstructive pulmonary disease, have been linked to the 1893 Humboldt County Civil War to the rise in people suffering from the disease in Dauphin County, North Carolina, and Spain.\nMann emphasized that the disease is not over and further studies are needed. However, he believes it will take at least five years to understand what precisely is causing this serious strain of respiratory illness.\n""Although it is difficult to get precise information about it, we do know from data from the World Health Organization and CDC that it is the virus and we are trying to start adding more information,"" he said.\nAdults in the US and visitors traveling to or from Puerto Rico, where the most common symptoms associated with respiratory contagion are coughing, sore throat, or a viral fever, are given antibiotics, but it is dangerous for Americans to take their own risks if an infected person feels ill.\nDoctors and volunteers have since learned of this latest case in Georgia, but many states are still investigating it and doing additional testing on individuals who are well in their illnesses.\nIf someone develops a breathing problem, respiratory symptoms then may start bubbling. Pregnant women may experience an improvement, but not from it, according to Mann.\nIf someone has high fever, constipation, or stomach pain, pneumonia or other health problems, respiratory symptoms can remain normal even after a few days.\n""No one is predicting it,"" he said. ""But this will be the first major case of respiratory contagion where people have symptoms.""\n']"

Our message to the American people is we want a problem every year so we take care of it and we know in Maine our citizens are going to say it\'s happening in the future and we\'re going to have to do something about it.""\nThe emerald ash borer was detected in Maine on Saturday. Its spread within the state was at least seven times the normal level, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management reported.\nMost of the pest\'s larvae are infestations out of underbrush and leaves. But invasive beetle larvae spread on vine leaves that leave the larvae young. The infestation has now killed more than a half million trees in Maine, according to the bureau.\nMany lawmakers are assuming the insect is posing a threat to their legislation to bring development onto federal lands.\n""You have to get it on the right side of paper before you can go and have a debate about it,"" Sen. Ladd P. Hickman (R-Ohio) said. ""But I think the solution is to remove the pests on government land and don\'t talk about the law.""\nThe emerald ash borer has made its way into Maryland and Massachusetts, where it has spread on soil near house harvests. It has already been found in Vermont, an area across the Susquehanna River off Durham County.\nSen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) proposed legislation last week that would prevent state agencies from monitoring and levying pesticide to curb crop damage.\nMore severe action could be put on the table, would actually prevent millions from getting hurt by the emerald ash borer, Leahy said. ""I\'m not speaking as a doctor,"" Leahy said. ""I\'m speaking as a law enforcement officer. What we have is a terrorist agency that has direct and indirect involvement in this invasion of human beings.""\nLeahy said the legislation doesn\'t affect the president or his administration, because there\'s no fear of the pest. He said he also wouldn\'t jump to a solution unless it was ready and it would have proven effective, including removing the beetle larvae from the state\'s soil.\n""This legislation is limited because we\'re dealing with a tiny insect,"" Leahy said. ""It\'s an invasive pest now who\'s been doing something but it\'s gotten much larger and much harder to control.""\nThe emerald ash borer frequently appears on tree branches and lawns and their swarms of insect are common in urban forests, according to the CDC.\nAmanda Van Deusen, commissioner of the Maryland Department of Agriculture, said the agency has long been trying to educate consumers about the emerald ash borer. ""We\'ve had a tremendous amount of interaction with people, and now we need to address what\'s being reported to us about the beetle,"" Van Deusen said.\n""We\'re just beginning to get the data we need,"" she said. ""It\'s been five years now we\'ve talked about this issue. I think it\'s important for everybody to understand what\'s happening.""\nHickman said legislators should address the emerald ash borer on every possible measure.\n""I\'m not saying we have to do it all and I\'m saying there\'s a lot of things that can be done,"" he said. ""These are very difficult issues to address. I don\'t think the people who say \'I\'m against this\' would necessarily mean they\'d have to fix them. They\'d want a problem every year.""\nVicki Lancaster, a research scientist at the Vermont Department of Wildlife, said she has seen examples of the ash borer since the 2015 outbreak, including one when a squirrel was infested with the beetle for 12 years. She said the search for this beetle will be intensifying, with more to come.\n""We\'ve never been able to tell the difference between it spreading to the whole state and the whole country,"" Lancaster said. ""This is an outdoor predator. We know of the grass humps that are under there, we know of diseases, and we know that there are things on the ground that cause it. But we\'re dealing with these urban fires.""\n']"

592,Coronavirus Will Change the World Permanently. Here’s How.,"['Earlier this week, we reported that Baxter International Limited has announced that it has identified an outbreak of PERS virus due to its use in ferrets. The company has made two accidental deaths a factor in the PERS search, so we saw a change in the world and one of the major players.\nWhile the company is publicly blaming its customer, it has instead issued an update, which recognizes that in the next few months there will be yet another PERS virus before we even know the exact number of cases. Since PERS is a serious illness, so it has been difficult to receive accurate information, a major source of concern for the health care system.\nWhat we do know for certain, however, is that in the next couple of months, patients will all come in for a visit to see if there is another PERS virus. We’re certain this time, they’ll look for a hint of PERS virus, and they will need to look for it for weeks at a time before they will be contacted.\nBaxter wants to be careful as to which types of PERS virus to detect, as they can in one day potentially yield large numbers of cases, as PERS is a very rare virus.\nHowever, it has so far not responded fully to its call, which is just one of the situations in which Baxter has released several new information. It certainly isn’t the only entity with a PERS virus. Earlier this week, Avastin Therapeutics called for more testing to find out if this virus had existed, or if the epidemic is contagious. This is a very challenging situation, as they are working to identify the PERS virus in the next few months and full doses, and are doing so with secrecy.\nIn addition, the Scripps Research Institute, which runs the Laboratory for Functional Medicine, has called for, on Saturday, engineers to start a project to check up on ways to prevent a new PERS virus coming soon. During that same announcement, the institute said that its research team will start the possibility of possible bacterial genome sequencing, which will also help to develop diagnostic tests.\nWill it help us? Yes. Those that have developed a variant of PERS virus will need to tell us what they have, and whether they have useful diagnostic criteria to look for the new PERS virus. That alone could help researchers develop effective diagnostics that can help us detect cases of the PERS virus.\nAdditionally, an RWECNI biosensor on the company’s manufacturing site in Switzerland should help to get a good estimate of the number of cases around the world.\nWhich brings us to what we have learned about the PERS virus of the future. Here is what we know, from a company spokesperson about the virus:\nPERS has no known viral origin,” explained Bruce Price, Chairman and CEO of Baxter International. “This virus doesn’t have a known pathogen or known change in genome. It’s most likely a compound that exists off a dominant, pre-existing germ line. Since no one else is accumulating a particular antigen, and because it’s a single-technology, manufacturing efficiencies, and combined treatment schedule have the potential to dramatically reduce the time it takes to reach clinical use of the virus.”\nThe fifth and last aspect we need to note in a recent report is the very large number of isolates from the ORRX genes that contain the new PERS virus. All of them are the solid-state compound that is used to conduct investigations of any of the causes of the infections, which was used to spread the virus into humans.\nSo there you have it, we’re nearing the tipping point where we can tell the world what the PERS virus is. Eventually, we’ll have multiple sources of PERS virus, and it might not be as bad as the recent cases that have brought concern, since we’re fairly certain this type of virus is up to something even shorter than the occasional one.

But, at the same time, his ardent supporters are irked that he hasn’t yet achieved the big things that many wanted to hear about. When you look at his 2020 campaign slogan, “One Million Dreams,” it suggests that Trump will be basking in the glow of his biggest electoral victory of his presidency.\nImagine that simple: Trump has doubled down on his personal hopes. There’s no way he would have two hopes for his presidency in a year, let alone in 2020 — which, alas, would have been much worse.\nThat first trillion-dollar hole — not big enough to fill a non-existent deficit, but not a trillion-dollar one — is the biggest among the eight most expensive in history. If someone replaces it, you have to build a new set of dams to fill. And, given that that is the only way the U.S. can finance infrastructure over the next 20 years (and make revenues and employment projections), you have to build roads, bridges, tunnels, stadiums, airports, public transit systems, and power plants. But is it achievable? That’s the biggest question we will have to ask ourselves.\nHow do we cover the costs, through social contracts, of building infrastructure? Consider a couple of broad points:\nIt’s impossible to fund expensive projects through taxes. The only other way is to raise new taxes. These taxes are explicitly targeting people and businesses that form the majority of the country’s economy. But that taxes haven’t helped American businesses for the past 20 years, as they’ve hurt efforts to prepare and put Americans back to work. As the Bush tax cuts have now passed, they’ve eroded the resilience of businesses to their realtor’s equity positions. These taxes have also taken a huge hit on human capital, as workers are less likely to acquire any degree of return on investment — and they’ve also made it easier for workers to find employers whose salaries are in greater demand.\nThe Bush tax cuts have also eroded the resilience of businesses to their realtor’s equity positions. These taxes have also taken a huge hit on human capital, as workers are less likely to acquire any degree of return on investment — and they’ve also made it easier for workers to find employers whose salaries are in greater demand. Capital is still spent now, by far the biggest source of human capital and the third-biggest source of capital outside of industries such as finance. Corporations could pour billions into infrastructure, to invest in trainable and technically literate entrepreneurs, and add 50,000 jobs to the country in terms of population and employment. But these investments are highly uncertain, and the answer is to increase the size of the pool of private investment by, say, $100 billion.\nInvestment flows today are not responding to rising demand. Instead, the fraction of business activity generated by capital investment is shifting to other commodities — from gold, grain, oil, and timber. These businesses — save the largest employers, such as the financial industry — are all on the sidelines.\nSo, the Trump presidency — assuming he succeeds in the re-election campaign — will include borrowing money from the International Monetary Fund, through subsidies for fossil fuels, and Trump’s commitment to budget deficits. By borrowing large amounts of American capital, he also draws on government debt and the large amount of wealth currently squandered on infrastructure development.\nBy borrowing huge amounts of money from the IMF, and borrowing large amounts of wealth currently squandered on infrastructure development, he is saying we need to throw more and more money at the problem. He is saying the rest of us should, by the way, just be grateful that we have a government that would finance education, infrastructure, and housing.\nhttps://www.nationalpost.com/private-illustration/electric-stocks-2017/05/one-million-dreams-trump-cliffs-the-trump-double-nation/\n']"

595,Opinion | The Smart Way to Save Jobs in the Time of Coronavirus,"[""Every single week, 23-year-old Pennsylvania woman Carol Sargent works, her email regularly gets hers replaced by a viral disease which seems to blow the girl awake every few minutes. Fortunately, she is not dying. It's no coincidence that the disease, found in animals, is the most common cause of cancer and death among dog owners, who fall into the category of “responsible” dog owners.\nWhile Sargent's diagnosis has been cause for celebration, it is very difficult to quantify the amount of change that could be made to reduce the detrimental effect of canine cancer. In this scenario, we can save jobs and watch record periods of economic growth, but we can't avoid jobs that are regularly destroyed if new technologies are not being developed into something better than human beings. And here is why I want to start a conversation here about how we can help ensure that these jobs are not lost unnecessarily while at the same time removing the stress and stress on the communities in which we live.\nWe can start by changing what you think of as the job of being a business owner; now let's do that. Let's start by looking at how other industries that would be affected by these diseases go through a serious financial transition. Start with thinking of them as beavers. Or a food industry. Or a factory. Or the pool of people that it usually takes to keep a company running.\nThink about what it would take to transform a business owner into a leader, by considering the number of wasted hours a person would have to spend, the number of hours they would have to waste to do certain tasks. Think about the expenditures spent by those employees on tasks that in any economy don't make sense, because the number of money spent on them is actually kind of small compared to the waste that workers accumulate. Think about the estimates that citizens of Pennsylvania would need to work on to run a business. Any that looks beyond the obvious, “economy at stake,” and build on previous experience and think about the value it has in the whole economy of working, both in terms of number of hours worked and money spent on the business.\nThink about the work that would have to be done by a secretary. Make that an organization. Think about her workload. Make that someone to supervise her while she is on vacation. Make that someone to supervise the people who would be there on business premises when she is away. Make that a coalition with the Fair Credit Reporting Administration. Make that a coalition to minimize the administrative burden of reporting property losses to the Department of Banking; that is, out of the checks that she signs, out of the costs that she takes to worry about clearing and maintaining the records that her husband would need to clean out. Think about how that could reduce the amount of time she spent working out of a cell. Think about how that would decrease the amount of time that she has to waste on the business needed to run a business. Think about how that could decrease the amount of money spent on salary bonuses, as well as increase the salaries of employees who would need to sleep with additional money for expenses or what has been mentioned is a service line.\nThink about how that would reduce the amount of time that she spends on other things like pet care and food. Maybe it could reduce that time she spent doing jobs that no one wants to do. Imagine that workers who do important work by their team could get laid off -- which is terrible because we need good working conditions for workers. Imagine that employers are so scared of losing that many employees because of the stress they are put under, they no longer fear losing working for the less fortunate. Imagine that employees who expect others to keep their jobs and pay them the full cost of living without feeling about the stress that they must put on their jobs -- which is real wages for workers -- would just be disheartened and would decide that not having the means to save these hard-working people would be a better choice for them.\nUltimately, it is time to make sure the jobs saved by these techniques are not going to take place in the financial system or industry that people live in. This would not only require change and encouragement, but also cash value creation. The shift that we are making, change that we believe needs to happen, is long overdue. I am so excited for the way this change is taking place -- it will likely have significant impact on the long-term prosperity of Pennsylvanians and people all across the state.\nMore than anything, the economic impact the changes we are making on lives are on the people who live in the area who are making the changes -- the people who are supporting the businesses they live in and making the people who live in the area where they work make the changes that we are making.\n[Adapted from Frances Kirby's website Made Possible: Meaning Empowering Students to Connect to the Community in the Work""]"
596,How ugly could it get? Trump faces echoes of 1929 in coronavirus crisis.,"['Shares\n, Washington, United States, Apr 1 – Trump’s Washington comments Saturday have played a part in the current crisis in coronavirus vaccine stocks.\nThe DNA virus has been making headlines for its ferocious ways into the world’s public schools, flooding university campuses with reports of sick sick pupils with viruses that were testing positive for the vaccine.\nIt is now the focus of an important investigation by US researchers, who say they are on the verge of developing a new vaccine that will keep infected children alive for years.\n“It has a 15 percent response rate to the vaccine against a very large number of cases of flu and pneumonia,” said Johns Hopkins immunologist Dr. Alan Guttmacher, who has co-authored a long-term study.\n“It would provide tens of millions of doses of the vaccine for years.”\nTrump has made vaccine headlines since returning from the beach in Florida at the end of last month.\nHe blamed the problem on conservatives pushing vaccines too far.\n“If you drink too much and don’t administer vaccines you are likely to get these types of viruses that are essentially synthetic versions of the human flu,” he said in a radio interview earlier this week.\nSince becoming president, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization has issued predictions of long-term outbreaks for both human and global use of new vaccine stocks.\nCurrently, only three companies – Aria, Dendreon and Janus – manufacture the vaccine.\nThat figure is expected to rise in 2020, with an FDA decision in favor of developing a vaccine now planned for 2021.\n“We’re still working to have a vaccine for 25 years or so,” said Dr. Eric Scowalt, who co-authored the WACC study.\nThe global outbreak of the 1918-19 epidemic of which 13 people were infected was caused by a virus that was never matched to the vaccine, and which appeared only on the respiratory and skin side.\nThe virus characterised the current outbreak by building up resistance to the vaccine and strengthening its vaccine.\nTesting the vaccine is expected to begin within a year, with subsequent steps such as giving it a smaller dose or having it repurposed.\nPatients have the opportunity to have it available for four doses to two years, while entire batches of the vaccine may be given as early as the second or third week of each year.\nIf successful, the vaccine could be used for preventing the spread of the disease after it is effectively distributed.\nThe WACC study comes a year after three additional families of infected people tested positive for a strain of the genetic virus, which is not genetically identical to the human flu virus and is not covered by standard vaccines.\nOf the 365 affected families, 300 were aged 17 and older.\nThe 70 percent of all cases were estimated to have occurred in the population of 522 people infected with the flu virus.\n']"
597,Big banks brace for coronavirus-related onslaught,"['Big banks already face a wave of warning from the public health advisory agency that a coronavirus, also known as coronavirus (CCV) has swept into Britain in some quarters since 1997, infecting some 1,300 people in Britain and a million others in the United States.\nIn July, an Australian newspaper reported that the spread of the disease had reached Britain from the continental European states.\n""We are just entering the summer and we\'re seeing plenty of news, no-one\'s really writing a lot about this yet,"" said Danial Reynolds, an Australian influenza medicine expert with the Australian National University (ANU).\nBanks are increasingly cautious of the vaccination campaign, which began last month. National anti-viral medicines, the Aventis Flu Index, are ongoing.\nPublic-health experts are cautiously watching developments. Michael Turner, who headed Australia\'s federation of vaccine producers, said the survey of vaccine adenovirus by the Australian National University (ANU) published in April was just a beginning and that the Dutch data could be validated as evidence that the vaccine is safe.\n""We just have to look at the history of treatment success ... once you introduce the disease to Australia, the numbers will have to go up.""\nIn September, Britain stopped the UK vaccination program for 25 days, after the virus emerged from the nearby spider eggs in an attack, and a week later they sent a notification to anyone who tried to get around the jab.\nAboriginal residents will again be targeted in new terms on August 1, when the vaccine begins its national phase-out. For that it will be up to farmers to get their their first dose of the new dose.\nThe scare around the two strains of the virus underscores Australia\'s perilous state. When scientists first detected a test-driving germ and egg, they suspected one was a benign and clearly dangerous germ.\nLast month, the British government commissioned new researchers to look at the early screening evidence. And with field trials in Australia only officially on Tuesday, sampling of infection samples will begin soon.\nThe virus is already circulating in Australia, with a ""very high risk"" a ""very high risk"". Norway in the Netherlands, which has one of the world\'s highest vaccination rates of 60% at five times its national average, is taking the risk a step further.\nIn Britain, a vaccine for coronavirus could be as cheap as £3.99, compared with £19.99 to £30 for a similar treatment that pumps the injection into infected people.\nThe Canadian government has even recommended large stock of doses for the vaccinated and a vaccinated young, although there is a strong feel good about their effectiveness.\nOutside the public health body this season, organizations are beginning to feel a little bit more comfortable about their declaration of vaccine effectiveness. It began in August, and around a dozen veterinarians and health workers have been invited to lead a series of workshops to discuss the new vaccine\'s effect.\nThree main issues are coming to a head: the potency of the vaccine, the long-term state of the disease and whether its long-term effects outweigh the short-term risks.\nWhile next year\'s vaccine is due to be produced, it is nonetheless a largely uncertain proposition. Production, advice and projection await the official start date.\n']"
598,How Republicans' tax overhaul could make a recession worse,"['By Bill Winters and Nancy Tartaglione\nWASHINGTON (CNN) — Republicans in the House and Senate were pushing for a major tax overhaul to be the centerpiece of their efforts to repeal the health care law.\nBut a quick internet search on the Trump administration’s Twitter account revealed Republican strategists’ new expectations for the Affordable Care Act, apparently built to the point that President Donald Trump’s Congress has only days left to enact the legislation.\nRepublican aides were quick to point out that a GOP Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would not be completed until the fall, at which point the president’s successor could begin his push for a tax overhaul.\nBut a person familiar with the political reality of the tax overhaul’s prospects told CNN that the current focus on the details of the legislation is misplaced.\nThat includes the much-talked-about provision that would eliminate some deductions and credits for those making $250,000 or more and those making $500,000 or more. Democrats contend that eliminating these so-called zero-rate deductions is necessary because we, as a nation, will pay more for healthcare if our biggest tax cuts of all are tied to higher healthcare premiums for low-income Americans.\nAnd Democrats argue that the new tax treatment does not go far enough to protect the millions of low-income Americans who pay no income tax and enjoy tax cuts on the top line.\nOne Democratic aide said the administration is attempting to “start processing” the paperwork for the tax overhaul and that the transition period for legislative action could be extended as early as Monday.\n']"
599,Mnuchin dodges on specifics of coronavirus' economic impact,"['WASHINGTON (CNN) - Congress still hasn\'t passed a long-awaited tax reform bill, but Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin defended the outcome during a press conference to address the potential economic impact of a new coronavirus strain in Japan, saying there are no red flags about its impact.\n""The coronavirus seems to not spread easily,"" Mnuchin said. ""When you are dealing with a cluster of 7 million people, we can handle that much more safely.""\nThe chief U.S. health inspector Robert Shiller said the upsurge of coronavirus infections has probably ""unfolded"" and has impacted upward numbers of Americans. Shiller said that since vaccines are used to prevent the disease, coronavirus infections usually take place from ""a decade or more in the embryo of the body"" to a few years or decades after the vaccination.\n""It might appear that a few years ago, we were well into a period where this outbreak started, and then it hit closer to the end of the disease\'s life,"" Shiller said. ""It may have helped reduce the infection rates over time, but the fact that it\'s happened many, many, many years, is pretty consistent with our previous experience with vaccine-preventing infectious diseases. So we are doing this to prevent the disease from beginning in the embryo of the body.""\nDuring an interview with CNN\'s Wolf Blitzer on Friday, China\'s Deputy Foreign Minister Shang Loi was asked to clarify a statement by the CDC, which earlier said that pneumonia is still the predominant type of the potentially virulent coronavirus. Shang said the Asian nation has seen ""moderate"" pneumonia cases this year, but had not had ""regularly observed cases"" due to an outbreak in South Korea. China has also seen ""most"" and ""red flag"" cases, Shang said. The CDC guidelines have not identified a single case, he added.\nClovis, New Mexico healthcare minister Dr. Milton Dyson said he is happy with the diagnosis of a new coronavirus, but thinks he needs more information to understand exactly how the treatment system works, and that he wants to hear more from Washington to see if it will be expanded to other counties.\n""I\'m hopeful that China will understand what the situation is and come up with concrete plans for what the authorities are going to do,"" Dyson said. ""I personally don\'t want to get complacent, and they need to stop waiting for their own public information.""\nOn Wednesday, the CDC said coronavirus cases have been reported in two countries: South Korea and Vietnam. The CDC said the first patient to be diagnosed with coronavirus is undergoing treatment, but U.S. officials have not confirmed that he is a new case. The CDC has yet to release a description of what the criteria are for a new coronavirus case.\nThe CDC said in a statement the number of patients it has identified so far would surpass the previous peak of 163, to illustrate how much work remains to be done in tracing and preventing the infection and to study the viruses in particular.\nThe NIH, a leading international health organization, released a statement on Monday saying that it is ""appalled"" at reports of an outbreak in the United States after the first cases were reported in Mexico.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is analyzing data from public health centers around the country, and it is ""aggressively focused on prevention and control measures designed to prevent transmission.""\nThe CDC has identified high numbers of people who are at high risk for the disease.\nAsked about the reported cases in Maryland, Maryland\'s Governor Larry Hogan called it ""tragic"" because it shows how early an outbreak can turn deadly.\n']"
600,‘I don’t want to use the b-word’: Trump aides race to rescue the economy,"['President Donald Trump is struggling to get a grip on struggling American businesses amid rapidly slowing growth and rising inflation.\nMost federal workers are not eligible for unemployment benefits this week for the first time since April 2016. Workers without unemployment benefits have been eligible for pension benefits since they were meant to take effect after the federal government shut down in March after a protracted recession.\nMany Americans are looking for work even as there is a slump in consumer spending, as wages rise and consumer spending surges. It’s not surprising that Trump’s latest economic plan – fiscal ones – has drawn less positive attention from GOP leaders, who wanted to use the first federal pay increase since 1991 to boost jobs.\n“It’s not exactly the Reagan plan,” said John Baugh, co-director of the Center for American Progress think tank. But he said the president must say more.\n“A lot of people were expecting nothing more than a very, very bad policy announcement, but it’s not really what we have in the world right now,” he said.\nThe Paycheck Fairness Act of 2010, whose protections have been in place for years, sets a $10,000 contribution limit for federal contractors. Americans eligible for refund checks will pay little more than that, while those making $50,000 or more will have to pay $12,000 in interest.\nTrump’s trade policies are under attack for raising import prices by $600 billion in three years. He’s argued that excessive tariffs help companies build American factories, shield foreign companies from retaliatory action, and boost growth. The administration says the tariffs hurt manufacturers and slow economic growth because the adjustments help companies rebuild.\nAt the White House, Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said Trump won’t set any specific tariffs to boost domestic hiring, though the U.S. could expand trade on technology, jobs and services.\nCongress set a Dec. 31 deadline to pass such a bill. The White House budget director suggested it would start phasing out Bush-era tax cuts for families earning $250,000 or more.\nThe first federal pay increase is likely next week.

601,How Cities’ Big Nonprofits Are Tackling Income Inequality,"['In an article for an upcoming online sustainability paper by The Scope and Equinox, South Africa-based Peter Bandfai and Tetsir Janaangana wrote about nonprofit organizations that have come forward to combat income inequality.\nDo these nonprofits care about disadvantaged people?\nJanaangana and Bandfai pointed out that nonprofits in the United States are, for the most part, dropping the inequality they offer income taxes. This is obvious in large corporations like Wal-Mart and McDonalds, which paid the tax back in 2016, and in large land and housing systems like Phoenix that Americans need help creating new housing opportunities and investing in rural areas.\nBut not all nonprofits are to blame for the inequality. What the organizations really care about is public policy that addresses poverty. For example, the University of Mississippi and Oxfam argue that efforts like increased land leasing and the increasing recognition of low-income housing opportunities could go a long way in reducing poverty.\n“They are concerned about housing equality and other issues that benefit the poor,” said Beopelli Gaughan, a Johannesburg-based philanthropist and former U.S. secretary of state who led the Oxfam efforts to highlight inequality in Eastern Africa. “They have a difficult time being a pro-poor organization.”\nHowever, the scientific literature is clear that American nonprofits have a long-standing interest in improving employment outcomes in rural areas. In a recent study from Colorado State University, Alexandra Shapiro of Penn State and students conducted three studies, concluding that non-profits have an advantage in identifying and responding to poverty and employment.\nRight now, they all focus on making interventions to address poverty and unemployment and unequal access to housing. That’s key.\n“A lot of small groups think of themselves as not critical about economic inequality,” said Michael Mobley, a professor at Rutgers University’s School of Public and International Affairs and author of Cotsotsotsots. “But we don’t take that seriously.”\nHalf of these organizations won’t mention issues of poverty or unemployment specifically, but rather address issues that impact social issues. Minding the difference between income and wealth, employees, and outcomes of educational attainment, non-profits might understand how vital these questions and values are.\nAnd a number of donor organizations recognize the need for change. The Energy Trust has placed more than $7 million into equalizing inequality. The Chicago Vision Fund has committed $25 million to funding local projects to tackle housing inequality. Ellen Munoz, executive director of the Philadelphia Volunteer Lawyers Association, which represents an estimated 200,000 legal professionals, says that the goal of the Working Families Party for Change isn’t eliminating the inequality.\n“None of our political leaders did anywhere near the task that’s happened in Silicon Valley,” she said. “And our record of many big philanthropic organizations has been mediocre, that they have only committed money to the wrong causes or didn’t do what’s required to create the best community.”\nThe Scope is looking to publish a paper that’s focused on the importance of public policy that addresses inequality. Ideally, the paper would outline specific policy responses. It’s a highly technical piece of research, but the findings will undoubtedly be invaluable. In the meantime, it will provide advice to nonprofits on how to better prioritize and address inequality in their organizational planning, finance, etc.\n']"
602,How Boston Is Becoming the City Where Workers Rule,"['Dollar General and Dollar Tree are asking the city to become the city where their stores are built.\nBoston has topped all U.S. cities for current workers\'s labor hours, according to data from The Economic Policy Institute. Whether or not their professional schedules predict many workers will leave the city in the next year, the reasons it\'s also becoming the new home for younger workers—this is a Boston example of how unions are playing politics at the local level. It doesn\'t matter where they work; workers don\'t quit. A new generation of workers is likely to be mobilized by the growing number of new urban workers born after 2000, and they are going to be directly responsible for creating an economy they did not know existed before.\nBetsy Cartwright, a labor organizer for Boston, argues that companies need to capitalize on these higher-paid workers, such as those trying to build retailers in the city, by making a city work for them, rather than nationalization or focusing just on a single segment of workers in general.\n""The farther the baby boom crowd goes, the harder it will get. Companies will need to pay workers more for hours, stronger protections, increased wages, better benefits,"" said Cartwright.\nBoston has strived for years to become the place where workers ever rose up against corporate oppression, and it has, in many ways, already achieved its goal. It began as a suburb of Boston, with a mile-long unruly street or two of formerly industrial subdivisions designed to accommodate the ever expanding urban population. Small streets, narrow squares and narrow streets made all the difference when workers were needed to shift from one place to another or cut supplies in one place or from another to cut supplies in one place.\nBut that all changed after the Civil War, as workers in key jobs fought for a better life under a national movement to unionize. Then there was an upsurge in urbanization, where job growth for manufacturing plants—the black market—was threatening to take a nosedive.\nThat\'s when Boston began to pull down the wall. In the 1960s, the city employed a record 3,000 laborers per day. By the 1970s, the city\'s workforce had swelled to 200,000. Today, more than 1 million of the city\'s roughly 2.5 million residents work for a variety of companies—including baby-boomer baby-generators like Kroger, United Parcel Service, Bed Bath & Beyond, and even Marriott International—whether on ""work days"" or ""hours.""\nAt some point, the city\'s workers will finally grab control of their own businesses, and employers will look to build an economy that nurtures them. Workers are less likely to prefer free, profitable jobs, but they\'re often more willing to commit to chains of businesses that pay their workers substantial wages and do more than they can do at home.\nDollar Tree currently operates its stores in a highly strategic area of the Boston City, and the company\'s employees traditionally work 16 hour days and three-to-five nights a week, but they do not have to keep their schedules high for fear that their scheduling conflicts will make it harder to see the light at the end of the tunnel.\n']"
603,Trump embarks on an epic fight to prop up the economy,"['A hastily assembled ""preliminary memo"" released after the presidential debate suggests that President Donald Trump should be leading a perilous, fact-free fight to prop up America\'s bankrupt treasury.\nRather than using the “legal processes” that might then be laid out in the next presidential election to raise the debt ceiling — as Sen. Bernie Sanders launched last week — according to Trump ally and conservative media figure Hank Brown, Trump would “engage a furious negotiation with Congress to get the country’s fiscal house in order.”\nThe memo also has the potential to make the latest round of budget negotiations with Congress feel awkward, given Trump\'s public support for slash spending on economic infrastructure and tax breaks. But an analysis by Democratic reform group Heritage Action did not encourage such an effort.\nRather, the memo runs the gamut of priorities, sources familiar with the matter said. First, it suggests that Trump should accept concessions from Wall Street, big businesses and others as a precondition to resolving the fiscal cliff negotiations in a simple way.\n“Trump should undertake key steps to restart negotiations, as he made clear in meetings,” said the source, who has spoken to Trump on numerous occasions on his campaign trail.\nTrump should publicly reject steep tax cuts for the rich and say he wants to roll back tax breaks for those who earn too much.\nThe same day Trump fired a portion of the retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, the Trump administration announced that for those making more than $1 million a year, pay no tax on their gains and losses, though it would take a cut of nearly 15 percent to break even.\nOn the other hand, the memo suggests that Trump should open the government to concessions from Wall Street.\n“Trump should offer to open the government to conditions on ending the Wall Street bailout,” reads the memo.\nThat admission makes sense. CEOs and congressional allies of Wall Street like to believe that the fissures that keep Congress divided are merely temporary because of the party\'s inability to successfully wrest control of the government.\nAside from the recurring appearance of a bunch of disgruntled lobbyists calling and sending members of Congress to malign their names, this memo is a confirmation of Trump\'s priorities — and they could include making major reforms like the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul fully and thoroughly enacted, or reaching a deal on the deficit-cutting centerpiece proposed by White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow.\nBut both proposals are being watched closely by workers who benefit directly from the GOP brand of anti-worker politics.

607,Trump launches an urgent fight to save his ticket to reelection,"['It’s a strategy that works well, but it’s still being considered by the Vice President of the United States.\nVice President Mike Pence is rolling out a new direct mail campaign that’s already attracting 60,000 new voters in a week, according to the New York Times.\nWhat’s holding up the response from the crowd is the size of the mail. Someone sent it in during a background check for an expensive car and the tone of the item read: “Your car looks good. Your buddy could have a really good one.”\nPence is just a few miles away, and at an event taking place at Boston’s Old Globe on Monday, he was asked about what his plans for his future are.\n“We talked about the billion-dollar cars that will be here, and the fact that we had the agreement to have all the companies be in the states so early this summer that’s what we should do,” Pence said. “That goes to the bottom line, what I believe is a virtuous cycle in which we’ll be able to deliver better service to voters than they’ve had, and I think we’ll have better access to cars. And frankly, I think that it’s a sure thing that we’ll have better roads.”\nHere are some of the questions made known during the 20-minute event:\n1. Is he ready to have a fourth-in-command after Ted Cruz ended his campaign?\nPence has been nominated to fill Cruz’s senate seat, but no one knows if the actual Republican running for that seat will be in place when the next general election rolls around.\nDuring an appearance on 60 Minutes, Pence teased that he would have his third term in office if Cruz were to lose.\n“Senator Cruz is doing a much better job than I have. He’s got a better job than I have. And that’s a good thing, because I think that what he and I have just done is what our public record has been accurate.”\n2. How effective has the mail campaign been?\nPence has introduced mail, targeting non-traditional voters at households located primarily in the Northeast and Midwest.\nPence said that he’s personally sought out four million homes in the Northeast and four million homes in the Midwest as of March, which allows him to bring campaign materials to people that do not consider themselves Republican.\n3. What plans do you have for the American people who are sick of the immigration situation?\nPence said that he is open to appealing to everybody.\n“Some of the countries that seem to be exporting their own drug crimes or creating jobs, I understand the right opportunity and ask the right questions and hear them,” he said. “We are going to be working with Mexico, South Korea, Colombia, Japan, Canada, most of the European countries that import drugs.”\n4. How do you reduce the number of violations?\nPence said that he’s talking with Congress now on a number of programs that will reduce the number of undocumented immigrants who may have been in the country legally.\n“We have policy clinics; we have over-the-counter medications; we have programs in housing, hiring programs and young people and taking a look at illegal immigrants,” he said. “We’ve heard many immigrants, while they’re young, from people who don’t have health insurance, offer a career. That’s the kind of way that I think we can do something for them.”\nIf the comments are any indication, if he continues to stay active, Pence would appear to have an edge over Cruz.\n']"

The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) forecast that it would reach 51.5 million this year, up 3 percent from a year earlier.\nBut with every three million people expected to travel in next year, if any positive trends take hold, the potential for diabetes to become the likely explanation for rising travel spending is huge.\nOnly one of the 20 high-yield stocks to report bad news this week includes the top 5 U.S. hotel operators.\nRelated Story US travel may rise a mere 4.4 percent this year - not before worst year since 1991\nMost of them were big cities with high numbers of tourists, meaning they are far more sensitive to travel-related changes such as whether some airlines will airlift empty or new planes.\nThe most frequently quoted example is DeKuye Beach, which recently ranked the top U.S. tourist destination, with a ""hotel-to-site ratio of 7:1"" and a capacity of 611,000 people.

He also provided training on surgery using anemic devices.\nA VA spokesman told the Daily Republic “As part of the VA’s Prevention and Warning and Preventive Services Acquisition Act,” VFW chapters took issue with the very rentable Ramble Subure, a white linen drip-and-dryer, twice a month for $2.50 per $25.\nThat relief from a bureaucratic logjam can be a welcome development for Veterans for Peace.\nThe Post-9/11 vets over at their VFW echo their disgust with VA health care by also demanding that the VA publicly severing ties with VA contractors would amount to anti-VA bias.\n“We don’t think that anything should be done about access to treatment,” Kyle Greene wrote in a Facebook post. “Everybody in the VA is just a target, and that’s why we are sympathetic to the circumstances that happened, and strongly, with respect to AARP. In the VA’s case, it’s their to blame, not the VA.”\nClichy submitted no written or verbal apology or apology for his actions and resigned in September.\nThe VA spokesman told the Daily Republic that when he was named by the country’s top court to oversee the agency after the Tucson shootings, the veteran even wrote in a note-to-meeting letter dated October 24: “I did not say I was pulling his weight, and I did not call the shots, nor did I think that I was failing to provide him the best care he deserved.\n“I wanted him to know that it was his honor to remain working, and I would like to share this with you as much as possible, and from that time on I saw no reason to leave this job where I spent my life at this agency.”\nThe veterans for Peace declined to comment. Clichy provided the Daily Republic with the following email exchange:\nWe decided that we had created a barrier to accept VA care as our health provider and that if we could not achieve satisfactory outcomes, our resolution was to end the War at All for Free. In honoring that cease-fire resolution in the end, we are publishing a message of thanks to the many vets who have served since 2007 who have battled the VA system throughout their careers.\n']"
611,Pennsylvania hit by more jobless claims than any other U.S. state,"['By Marc Levy (Reuters) - Pennsylvania could be the next financial state hit by its newest unemployment rate that threatened to overshadow other regions, a Reuters analysis showed on Wednesday.\nThe Pennsylvania unemployment rate was 4.1 percent in April, unchanged from March. It was a worse four-month average than February\'s official average. The data comes after stronger-than-expected U.S. job gains, such as a pick-up in employment by 240,000, in March, were widely expected.\nThe sluggish job market could pave the way for stronger job creation for the state, according to Wells Fargo Securities analysts Jay Porter and Robert Derr.\nThe state\'s unemployment rate is the lowest it has been in at least a decade. In February, 7 percent of workers with two or more years of education and work experience were receiving unemployment aid. As of March, 7 percent had already received benefits, the lowest of any state.\nPennsylvania is also the only one of the 21 states to average a higher number of jobless claims than the national average. The state also said the natural disaster that tore apart the state in December made housing prices and unemployment in that area a ripe time to seek help.\nThe increase in the number of people seeking unemployment aid is another reason Pennsylvania is in play as a hotbed for job growth, Porter and Derr said.\nThe benefits applications and the backlog in the backlog are similar to those made by states such as California, they said.\nPrivate employers added 129,000 jobs to payrolls in March, according to the Labor Department. That marked the first monthly gain since November 2013. Pennsylvania added 68,000 jobs last month.\n""I think the jump in private employment complements what we\'ve seen for the month of March,"" Scott Willens, the head of market research for Wells Fargo Securities in Chicago, said in a phone interview.\nOverall, Wells Fargo forecasts that the economy will expand at a steady rate in the second quarter, which would end as a weak government budget cycle.

But you are soon to discover that real-life clubs are full of lustful minds bent on pleasing customers.\nAs we head into the last six months of 2019, this exotic city opens up to a myriad of new discoveries and new challenges for its leaders.\nA good example is the rise in young entrepreneurs eager to make a name for themselves. Aside from the obvious attraction of the capital, London’s youth culture is probably also the key to the city’s growth, as prosperity, prosperity and success look like dreary theories over gold-plated bitcoin coins.\nGiven the high data rates of young entrepreneurs and the opportunities available for the British among them, why didn’t this phenomenon spread more widely? Do the dearth of attractive young entrepreneurs make this business market lose its charm?\nIt can either be quite basic economic wisdom, or delusional naivety. What is clear is that the ideal solution is so bleak, so desperate, that ambition can often be thwarted.\nThere are other reasons for this, but it's very important to bear in mind that.\nThe City is, first and foremost, also about men and women. The sexier the sexier, the more male those men become.

What drives visitors’ decision to hop on its Tube or ferry over and over again?\nIf the specific things attract you, that’s because they do.\nChildren, catamaran trips, nightlife, beauty workshops, nightclubs and boutique hotels all can lure visitors back to these national centres. If you want it, you can jump straight to one of the equally compelling things about London's suburbs: the undignified, low-maintenance art centre.\nBut do you imagine it?

All have Jolly Rancher recipes, but grab them instead.\nBobby Kennedy Airport: Almost 3,000 meals per day were shipped in such planes last month. The cost of the operation of processing the meals was “several hundred thousand dollars” higher than anticipated, according to airport manager Harold Cosgrove.\nDenver: This is a coastal city with a historic cattle-print that breeds cows and sheep. The only accommodations for the animals are a 3-foot-by-2-foot stable and meatstand.\nCalifornia plants\nCoral Springs: A gem in the Sunshine State, 40 years ago this month California became the first state to ban so-called genetic breeds of cattle, turkeys and pigs from its soil.\nCalifornia’s agriculture officials are planning to import frozen meat from Oregon, where fed pigs produce pig tails, cauliflower and broccoli. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that there are about 58,000 pigs, about 11,500 turkeys and 20,000 pigs on state-owned farms.\nState officials told The Associated Press that another top threat looms for California’s billions of dollars in federal funding.\nCalifornia has one “fundamental flaw” with the process, and that is not protecting the supply chain. Farmers planting soybeans, corn and other crops that don’t comply with their state laws are not adequately protected, leaving animals vulnerable, resulting in damage to the environment and livestock producers, according to UC Berkeley researcher Allan Goodening.\nHigh frequency of illness\nGuadalupe, Mexico: A bacterial infection linked to cow dung and bird faeces can result in death in newborns and babies. The disease is called juvenile dung fever and impacts the lives of children,, women and adults.\nState officials have seized health-care supplies for the U.S. Fertilizer Co., which cares for animal feed for its ferries.

616,L.A. expands sick leave amid coronavirus — but only for employees at big companies,"['LOS ANGELES — A killer coronavirus that was linked to deaths in four LA area hospitals won’t cause people to die in one. But doctors don’t consider the disease dangerous enough to pose a dangerous risk.\nThe only terminal illness that could do it to anyone is influenza — without bearing any link to the crowded, crowded and filthy medical facilities.\nUntil now, that was a problem as the nation’s costliest flu season got underway with four superbugs linked to Los Angeles. The MERS coronavirus has been found in 40 Californians and moved to this year’s Oscar-nominated San Diego Zoo, home to the 2014 case of Avian flu.\nThe Department of Public Health began examining cases of the coronavirus through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in September — its only study before going out on a mass alert and recommending higher-risk cases of the disease.\nThe discovery in April 2015 was reported in parts of San Diego where a single case was infected with the infection. The California Department of Public Health recently said a laboratory confirmed for the latest outbreak the strain of the virus has been found in California. The drug used in the investigation is thimerosal, which protects against antibodies that cause brain damage.\nBut there are limits to the department’s new estimate, given reports that officials suspect the pathogen has been in the respiratory system for up to five years and it is not associated with childhood infections. It is unclear how the disease grows.\nThe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which takes in about 1.4 million cases of infectious illnesses each year, said the coronavirus was noncontammable. They think humans play a small role in the majority of new cases of coronavirus infection, and that means its small amounts of viral particles can be more harmful to the immune system than ones that can cause other viruses.\nThere are no known infections that catch people from the coronavirus, but the CDC’s early analysis found that higher-risk cases were found in city hospitals. Not too much is known about the virus’ early deaths.\nNot surprising then, because coronavirus vaccines are effective against H5N1 and H5N1 H5N1 viruses in humans. They have only a two-year shelf life and the CDC has said that’s not counting on the vaccine’s introduction in 2018.\n']"
617,Jeff Bezos’ deal for Paul Allen’s undeveloped land falls through,"['LAKE WILLIAMSBURG, Pa. — A single-elimination swap this week to buy Paul Allen’s undeveloped land in what was one of his highest-profile investments became official Wednesday.\nThe $4.67 billion deal, to be completed in what is still the largest equity sale of the year in the south and northern suburbs, remains on schedule for the late July quarter. The earnings will be gathered through an equity infusion from Gordon Ramsey, the legendary writer and philanthropist who died Thursday.\nBears allege that Oklahoma businessman Allen, who is known for philanthropy, called the deal — formally called the Paul Allen Partnership — and reeled them in.\nThe press releases on both sides came in the midst of the deal’s second hourlong hearing and should force the deal to be completed at a later date. It was not immediately clear how Allen, 37, would react or where he would stand in litigation.\nAllen family spokesman Aaron Brown said Thursday that the deal is “not our only option.”\n“Everybody in my family’s financial choices are made in Massachusetts and our family lives here in Southern California,” Brown said. “No matter what is likely, we are not sold on either Paul Allen or the Paul Allen Partnership.”\nBrown said both issues were worth less than a couple thousand dollars each.\nFormer Lt. Gov. Phil McCrory said Wednesday he would be involved in legal disputes with Allen’s management over the company’s finances and the Koch brothers-owned media, although he cautioned there would be no resistance from his group.\nBut Ted Koch, the governor of Alaska, who is seen as an ally of Allen, said the deal would pay Allen much more to explore the up-or-down market.\n“There will be litigation, but there will be getting rid of the companies that we already own, and this is the right step in doing that,” Koch said.\nThe Allen group is expected to issue news releases during its “road show” to air Wednesday night at Southport’s Fox Theater.\nMurray D. Wicklein, who was chairman of Allen’s real estate investment company, Landlord Capital until Allen bought and closed the stake in 2014, was scheduled to testify Wednesday and would join investors under questioning.\nHe’d previously testified in December on behalf of the Allen group.\nStan Schel, director of Arkansas law firm Davis Payne Winthrop Polling in Arlington, Texas, where the Portman family is based, was scheduled to testify for Allen.\nAll told, at $12.5 billion — a compound annual growth rate of about 20 percent — it would leave the Allen group with roughly $100 billion to invest in the 23 states and localities that provide the majority of its land.\nWhether that value could be enough to live up to the expectations of the millions Allen would have built into his family portfolio, are a quibble the lawyers will likely argue.\nUnder Armstrong Communications Inc.’s existing contract, Allen must be able to charge steep profits if he just sold it to pay for growth — a process that can take two years or longer — and then have to reinvest the proceeds in the business, until next year.\nAllen could also bundle both deals into a separate transaction, or it could leave some W&M-related assets to be sold as more cash came in than investment.\nAllen owns more than 80 percent of W&M and more than 20 percent of Appalachian Coal Co., the largest coal producer in the US, and W&M owns the Northwest Trail, a tree-lined track to nine Appalachian coal mines to be built in Tennessee.\nGreenBay Communities, a Dallas real estate investment firm, is contracted to manage the former Stanley Financial Land & Trust property, in Dallas County near Washington. The company has pledged $225 million in new bonds to the Westcott Development Group to lease the land for Kalamazoo Crossing, a $800 million regional center for low-income housing.\nThere is another $600 million to be purchased into the Allen plan by another Dallas firm, Saint Airy Realty Partners. That type of investment is still in contract.\nA heavy component of Ramsey’s business is his ability to travel from Wichita to Beverly Hills, La., to California. Ramsey has flown from Wichita to the Memphis Grizzlies, the NBA’s Memphis Grizzlies and the Clippers.\n']"
618,Who qualifies for the coronavirus stimulus payments?,"['The Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Climate Change have released new information showing that Vladimir Izvestinzwalltsev, one of Russia’s main project leaders on the Halvor land piece dispute, was a member of the Ministry of Climate Change. Izvestinzwalltsev is a former Russian policeman who is rumored to be a research expert. In an interview this week, Izvestinzwalltsev explained that he was one of eleven former ministers with a prior emergency declaration during the Fall of Communism. He added that the line has apparently been drawn on Russian interpreters who sometimes misread their language or get lost in translation. There is no link to Izvestinzwalltsev in the body language of Russian officials. In a position where official discussions often have to go through human translation in English, it is difficult to calculate the meaning of these words. In the future, Zhhtsinov may want to add his name to the list of accordingly and honoured War Games officials. U.S. Embassy officials are also commenting on the renewal of the eco-dammitage funding program. The program promotes young environmentalists among early summer projects in the Arctic. By 2015, about 10 percent of the money is to be given out through the end of the year. Odyssev and Viktor Andrianov, the partners of the Ministry of Energy and Environment, received their licenses to work on environmental projects in the country in December 2015. The Ministry of Environment is responsible for driving various development projects, including the 2012 Arctic Arctic Solar Solar project. According to the new information, the total amount allocated to the Ivanpah project, which is located outside the capital of Moscow, is $2.8 million. The requirement for an article in the Order Number S323700 from Uzbekistan was approved by Uzbekistan’s Foreign Ministry on a 350-kilo dollar project. The article describes the project as designed to carry out energy generation stations for high energy-efficient houses and hydroelectric plants and also provide energy to the national grid. Some 27.3 billion shillings of that sum would be required to buy three electric cars: three three-car hybrid vehicle, each weighing hundreds of kilograms and costing $30,000. The projected expenses, is estimated at $135 million, are based on a market price of $65. The National Petroleum Company is attempting to place seven hydroelectric plants in Turkmenistan. The Energy and Mineral Water Development Fund for Turkmenistan is under state control and designed to pump geothermal electricity from the Euphrates to the central province. On the back of the energy development funding, it has allowed hydroelectricity from Sembel to the Sejil River site in Turkmenistan.\n']"
619,Hard-hit cruise lines don’t get U.S. coronavirus stimulus money,"['NEW YORK — Boat owners, business owners and cruise line operators said they won’t get any money from either U.S. or European governments because “there is no certainty” the United States can secure money to protect everyone’s lives.\nComplaints are already swirling that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration should immediately reconsider grants it granted last year to ship makers such as Carnival Corp., Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise Line for corrosion protection aboard oil tanks.\nThe proposals call for plans to update ship maintenance programs at ports on U.S. coasts, and earmark money for U.S. munitions, submarine programs and other programs to mitigate the risk of future diesel explosions. One of the other proposals calls for an industrywide review of ship corrosion protection programs to prevent future oil spills.\nIn a letter sent Monday to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the Navy’s plan to reestablish ship corrosion protection at ports nationwide, including three of the Gulf states, doesn’t really give adequate credit for the cash.\n“USFDA needs and deserves” the billions of dollars it would have to pay to defend against the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Mullen wrote in his letter, just minutes after a sailor was reported missing following a Caribbean cruise in February.\nMullen denied a U.S. document was meant to frighten ships from exporting to the U.S. or foreign markets.\n“If the Navy can’t protect people’s lives and safety, that tells me they’re doing their homework. It’s a good lesson for the Navy,” said Jonathan Maykala, co-chairman of the Morrigan Advisory Group, which promotes the Navy and security on U.S. coasts.\nMaykala, who heads the Maritime Administration under Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, said it was “unwarranted to imply that the Navy doesn’t have any problem with any beneficiaries” of U.S. government assistance, which it calls “obligatory.”\nThe Navy and Coast Guard have been trying to improve corrosion protection at ports nationwide for years, but some manufacturers, shipbuilders and shipyards all oppose ship corrosion protection at ports.\nA 2012 motion that addressed how port regimes need to be more diverse was attached to the 2013 Act which authorized the Navy to get money for reinsurance and self-insurance for ships built at large ports. Several ships built in that industry were delayed for too long because of the stockpile of chemicals deemed necessary.\nIn 2015, however, three shipping safety inspections in different states — Arkansas, Virginia and Texas — were transferred to a U.S. District Court judge in Arkansas, according to maritime records obtained by Military.com. The shipyards that received $2.3 million in grants didn’t say whether they’d like to be approved for upgrades.\n“I don’t have a problem at all. It’s all our regulatory process. We want to do what’s best for the ship. But it sounds as if they want us to play dirty,” said Jack McClure, president of CorVel Industries, a firm that works for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons.\nMichael Besford, a lawyer with the Navy after spending most of his career defending ship safety officials, echoed that view Monday.\n“It’s a case-by-case question, and they’re taking whatever action they’re comfortable with. Whether it’s for, say, one mile, or two miles, they want us to play our game,” he said.\n']"

623,Has your favorite shop or restaurant gone out of business because of the coronavirus?,"['Fetal RSV infections are increasingly on the rise globally, according to a new report by researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, which discovered the human influenza vaccine The H1N1 flu this year has a compound gene, which can cause AIDS or other infections.\nNow, the researchers have documented how the H1N1 virus has evolved from a late-stage strain found in pigs without a more complete system, to one that’s quickly spreading thanks to renewed research on the virus.\nPHOTOS: 7 foods to stop buying\nResearchers performed a systematic analysis on 643 healthy H1N1 patients who had not been exposed to the H1N1 virus, and found the virus has a “hyperperpetual change” and now spreads between regions. Some patients were found to have ever-growing blood deficits in the circulatory system, which can prevent the virus from adapting to its new host.\n“Finding a consistent path from influenza to the H1N1 virus is vital to the success of the Viral Influenza Prevention Program at the National Institutes of Health,” according to the release.\nThe researchers conducted a cross-sectional study of 2,353 people who had been vaccinated against the common influenza (swine flu) virus over the past 2-1/2 years. Participants were randomly assigned to receive three doses of S.H.A.H.P2 (H1N1 strains), one shot of the H1N1 antigen and one dose of the H2N1 genetic variant (H2N1 varieties). The virus was genetically engineered to transfer nearly any gene known to that particular group (a single number of different sequences of several different pheromones is involved).\nThe researchers analyzed the immune system activation in the participants who acquired the H1N1 virus; three variants of the H2N1 virus were identified in the volunteers. “This is the first time such a study has been done into the H1N1 virus genome,” said lead author Professor Erik Machanwitz, a graduate student who has spent her career researching H1N1 so far.\n“In addition to [hyperperpetuation], there are several other secondary versions of H1N1 being produced, that are similar in structure, component design, and tracking. The new data are significant for us in the sense that they found that the H1N1 virus appears more active throughout the H1N1 genome; many controls for ‘default’ H1N1 virus were also identified,” Machanwitz said.\nOverall, the researchers found that the H1N1 virus was relatively new in nature, and scientists have for months been trying to figure out what had started it in 1918. One of the major causes was the emergence of a new influenza, which gave the virus new characteristics that allowed it to “jump ahead of itself,” researchers said.\nPHOTOS: 7 foods to stop buying\nThe virus has recently been making its way into numerous countries, including India and China, because it is also being transmitted through the air. The team is now working on a host-nation antiviral cocktail to help manage the spread of the H1N1 virus, as well as addressing gene-segment and antibody resistance.\nThe researchers are now studying potential more controlled variants of the H1N1 virus before declaring that there are signs that they may be pathogens of a new strain, Machanwitz said.\nWhen tested, the researchers found that while the H1N1 virus was genetically engineered to pass the virus with a number of different pathways, that the H1N1 team is not. The researchers say this raises the question of what humans have made of the H1N1 virus since it’s birth in 1918, and why some people are only mildly affected, while others have all but died from the H1N1 virus.\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?

Seventy-seven percent said they were ""done with their personal finances"" and 72 percent said they were ""getting just a little ragged.""\nThe ABA\'s report to Congress appears aimed at the electorate, the so-called Millennial generation, targeting only college graduates, whose share of the workforce in the survey will reach 19 percent this year. The generation is also at the top of a Millennial population survey of millennial Americans. They were 41 percent of Millennials and 60 percent of Gen Xers, the report says.\nBut the rising share of the nation\'s aged urbanites is making the current economic crisis turn ugly for other reasons: Millennials are losing trust in the federal government and on Wall Street, and therefore ""becoming more susceptible to political manipulation and relentless changes"" due to economic downturns, according to the report.\nLast month, the report highlighted concerns that, as the nation warms and cuts to Social Security are rolled out, the age of millennials is rising in importance to the downturn.\nThe report says Generation Y — also the generation of not-yet-post-college-aged Americans — will be the first to experience dark times, with 70 percent of Americans likely to age 65 or older.\nMillennials are competing with older Americans, and they have ""lost trust in the conventional wisdom, one of the underlying causes of the current economic crisis,"" according to the report.\nBased on their experiences in the survey, ABA\'s survey does not break down age, gender or income.\nAs the recession deepens, the report says, people are more sensitive to change.\n""The upward trend in monthly working wages that experienced in 2007 to 2018 is expected to accelerate as people are discouraged from growing their families,"" the report reads.\nThe report found young Americans ""are more likely to say there are too many ‘baby boomers.’ and more likely to say they are too ‘modern’ or ‘young’ than older Americans,"" and 55 percent of Millennials say they are currently unemployed.\n']"

Infectious diseases deaths have been almost 8,000 and infectious disease claims to be 1,000.

He offered few specifics, calling the tax plan a “draft and free market solution.” He was vague about current tax rates, suggesting he would replace that with simpler and fewer popular programs like the Medicare prescription drug program.\nWhile his tax plan has some specifics, some of them were ambiguous.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Trump believes most of the tax changes would be quickly passed - a proposal he discussed on a wide-ranging news conference Friday. He had not provided details.\nSeveral Republicans have questioned whether a tax plan would blunt the impact of a rising tide of Trump tax cuts.\n\'I BELIEVE THAT IS GOING TO BE AN EVENT OF PUBLICITY\'\nBefore the summit, Trump said he welcomed the business leaders’ statesmanlike reaction to Trump’s statement to reporters Friday that “any time you make it through a tough world, you have to deal with them.”\nFrom a speech to the annual Madison League convention in New Orleans, Trump said he respects the business leaders who were standing alongside him Friday.\n“I believe in a common purpose of everything we do,” Trump said. “I believe you should come through tough times as a business person, and we’re going to work hard to make sure that I have a great president and a great businesswoman who has a great business model that can grow.”\nIn speeches following the summit, the economic adviser also pledged to work with federal regulators to develop more oversight of healthcare.\n""The bottom line is that we think doing government regulatory challenges right now is too expensive, too time consuming, and it\'s time we take a look at what we can do better and really try to think outside the box to see if we can do a better deal,” Paulson said.\n']"
628,Here are remote jobs that could keep you working through the coronavirus era,"['If these job offers fail, we may be lost to a public health disaster. If they don’t, I know they won’t be earning anything at all and we won’t be able to agree upon a pay package. This is the time to make a decision about whether to accept offers from private or public-sector positions that offer better pay, benefits and quality of work.\nPolicymakers want our innovation, creativity and innovation in the workplace to live more smoothly. It’s up to those who work in industries and industries regulated by the Federal Government to decide whether to accept all of these opportunities.\nThe participation of individuals in these open participation online platforms is essential and can allow us to listen to and trust decision-makers for their views, actions and insights. It is something we must stand on, so that we can respect open professions.\n“These platforms should not be shuttered because the vast majority of people are inclined to vote for participation and work by itself,” the Minister in charge of employment and employment management, and one of the communities Cabinet members who issued a press release earlier this week. “The point is that all employment providers and employers should be able to exercise their legal right to exercise these participation and work interests for all employment providers including membership of these platforms and people who volunteer to participate.”\nThe forum for achieving the transparent and supportive digital employment landscape has emerged along the lines of the PILESMOSYDECOST COMPETITION. PILESMOSYDECOST COMPETITION is an open enterprise at the federal level that seeks to replace the old intergovernmental governance arrangements that cover the socioeconomic, systemic and foreign affairs aspects of economic and social transformation. It is important that the federal government accept this platform as a source of collaborative policymaking, discussion and debate.\nPeople with dedicated short-term career aims will freely and effectively exchange ideas and relationships with their employment providers and stakeholders about current trends and then organise and negotiate these partnerships and engage in every project. The figures presented today are yet another example of the procurement process affecting working professionals in this area. It is, therefore, important to have an open, transparent, supportive and engaged digital platform to enable us to participate effectively.\nTrade and Labor Affairs Minister Peter Dutton’s latest announcement regarding the integration of PILESMOSYDECOST COMPETITION into the Federal Government Ministerial system has brought welcome respite to the long-running debate concerning how to integrate the PILESMOSYDECOST COMPETITION.\nIt seems essential that the Executive agrees on this platform as a key component in this campaign. The committee already has its findings and recommendations gathered from a number of conversations. The platform would be an opportunity to improve communication and the standards needed to achieve implementation, and generate feedback on solutions. It also allows independent verification for each bidder before competing companies can use it. In all, the federal government’s current attempts to mandate the arrangements should be taken seriously.\nAfter all, the Federal Government could not always do it for free. One solution suggested is to experiment and experiment within sectoral levels. In other words, we would have fresh reviews of the many sub-sector areas that are currently not being considered or that are not being put under scrutiny.\nThese reviews have the potential to help improve technical and regulatory processes to improve the delivery of employment services. There is a clear framework in place and integration is possible. The PILESMOSYDECOST COMPETITION Committee has agreed with the Federal Government’s support and offers to look at two issues that could improve cooperation: flexible employment arrangements with employers (benefit-dependent arrangements, which would simplify the work environment for the CEO), and flexible contract arrangements which facilitate work within the arrangement (PILESMOSYDECOST COMPETITION Collective Agreement).\nThe balance that the Commission has proposed may itself be inadequate because these arrangements could have resulted in lower levels of employment as a result of the PILESMOSYDECOST COMPETITION Committee’s approach. In reality, there would be more industry participation at risk if it is not tied to a project process and carefully structured and won’t be considered for the PILESMOSYDECOST COMPETITION Committee’s deliberations.\nWith the discussion wrapped up, whatever the future PILESMOSYDECOST COMPETITION Committee plans, the Federal Government should act. They should appreciate the path they have chosen and dedicate themselves towards making this new platform a success.\nMalaroya Ashwar is the United Party parliamentary secretary for Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises.

Use the Parrot Brain tool to create your own customized guides.\nOn Saturday, diversified tourism companies visited Maine’s ports, ports and amusement parks hoping to profit from a “riot” free of fuel taxes on motorized vehicles. But as the week progressed, the tug-of-war between the two sides intensified.\nLast week, Ryan DeKakis, a retired rickshaw driver, visited Augusta National Cemetery, where he found 1,050 headstones that had been left by grieving family members, according to his recounting.\n“It was pretty devastating,” he said. “They didn’t know what they were going to do. It wasn’t so bad. They just left it everywhere they could find it, and it took it from there.”\nBut the cemeteries haven’t forgotten their roots. And the games could be all bad.\nScott McKant, who retired after 25 years at the Hanover Hempstead Marine Expos, said the course of the day, a trip to the amusement park ride Jacob’s Pillow, made it hard to find anything that resembled the cemeteries of Maine.\n“There was definitely a sense of impassiveness,” he said. “There was no one there that would believe that was the park.”\nZeeland resident Billy Kahn added, “It just kind of felt like an un-civil conversation, more of an alley thing. I felt like I’d be home.”\nBut the Graves’ revelations also shed new light on the tragic history that has shaped the retreats and multimillion-dollar success rates for the RV industry, as seen through the eyes of an army of long-time operators.\n“I think this has them wondering more than anything, ‘Oh, did they make money?’ ” DiPietro said. “You don’t get a decent customer unless you have that much steam. And this is basically flooding out of them.”\nLake Superior League president Nat Reiner said there are only two official staterooms in the St. Petersburg area: the Hauptman’s Bill and the Parks & Wildlife Park.\n“The experience of spending time together was shocking,” Reiner said. “The experience of going back to your old home, spending time with your family and trying to rebuild their lives is something that neither of you are accustomed to.”\nCorporations, hotels and restaurants would have had a hard time charging for access to local parks through 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. while hammering out prices, Reiner said.\nBut the threat has boosted tourism, said Matt Stalley, a professor at the University of Minnesota at Lake Zurich who studies the business of producing local attractions.\n“It’s not all that profitable for RVs and other boats if people can’t get around for a few hours,” he said. “That’s in some ways what a lot of tourists don’t get. This is something that companies like RVs and camper-car companies have to deal with in order to survive.”\nThat doesn’t mean that all companies that haul in the cargo off shore, said Jim Stephenson, president of Vicksburg RV Export Institute.

630,Review: FreeUp offers remote jobs for freelancers and web developers,"[""Who wants a paycheque? And with a loose budget, where could you find an app to build and keep on your payroll?\nThose are the questions freeUp and Founder Geoff Doctor have been asking since 2011. Since then, the two have created a bunch of tools and apps to help freelancers and web developers get comfortable with multiple options for their tasks, from the small to the big.\nThe latest one is freeUp, a new app for freelancers.\nLifeFree, which launched in 2013, has its roots in ReadyQuad, the company that provided download pricing for information security tools at my alderman.com, and BuildUp, an educational apps for web developers. As the name implies, many of these apps offer access to online developers’ resources, guided to using them as professional tools.\nFreeUp is first launched alongside the announced 2015 update to download software.\nIn the weeks since it was first released in 2013, each of the apps has been updated to work with freeup, making it much easier for the community of users to access them and “easily work with them.” The apps can also use the available freebase for free.\nThe freeUp app is simple. Rather than having to scan your profile, it will search and document everything in it. You can also choose which applications you choose, then enter a credit, address, and recent information to take into account.\nNow if you want the best algorithm for prioritizing your freelance projects, both all the apps, and your job, you can use some of the freebies — this takes a little bit of organization, especially if your idea of launching a website is simple.\nOriginally, FreeUp’s focus was primarily on those freelancers working on WordPress.com and other online sites. So you likely knew about freeflow and knew about it from the outset — it’s a subject the app understands well, and its publication is somewhat local, with a map of the web's square mile.\nUnlike FreeUp, OneLink, which did development work for a few other firms, gave it a straight-forward focus on the internet and granted more access to a wider audience.\nFruit Bead and EasyEnemy, which let users apply makeup, attract preferred backgrounds for sites like MyMain, and generic mobile information to communicate the underlying code. As an example, you can say goodbye to your college dreams by visiting an app that uses any name that comes in the app's code.\nOneTake, which makes money from charging for live conferences and websites, also has its own digital “cloud,” as does Artscape, which aims to provide more granular opportunities for distribution.\nAnd the freeup app includes perks such as unlimited admin for product development, seven hours in every meeting, one login for all meetings, a place for websites to go to lay out their entire offering, and access to freebase for major web developers, providing expertise for development.\nFounded in 2014, FreeUp will join forces with HowTo, an affiliate of People.com, a popular for providing tools to online developers and web creators, as part of its initiative to help freelancers get more comfortable with multiple options for their tasks, from the small to the big.\nThe app’s creators were especially curious about what a freeflow approach looked like, which lets users configure their own self-reported work so they can assign their own ideas, have their own app, a set of tools and templates, and assign to each of them a “focus.”\nThere are no direct counts, but for many of the users on the freepack.com, it is more important that they have “focus” than they would say on Handoff, which lets users brainstorm when it comes to teaching and support software.\nThe FreeUp platform, which has a user-friendly interface, works on iOS and Android smartphones and tablets and Google Chrome devices (or quite a few add-ons), and brings the interactive experience that seamlessly blends online and offline development to the web.\nAfter testing the freeFlow platform before its launch, one person I know still wrote me a dedicated blog post earlier this year.\nThe FreeUp team has been busy building their app, launching various new features and finding new partners for its services, including a business model for its app and a web series network.\nAnd as the end of their app has come, they’re looking for more and more opportunities to make freefall more difficult.\nA word of advice:\nA better process for discovering new clients, tools and services is below.\n""]"

632,Column: It’s not too soon to think about how to give workers permanent raises,"['Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have both raised concerns about the prospect of annual increases in the cost of prescription medications like Prop 36. For decades, PBMs have offered annual increases — one for every five prescriptions purchased. Under the new federal proposals, those health benefits would rise by over 25 percent, up from an expected 15 percent.\nHowever, those increases may not be enough to reverse the trend that saw many individuals lose benefits earlier this year, according to The Wall Street Journal. Employers would soon be forced to cut pay and duties to placate employees, threatening the health of millions of retired workers.\nWhile the proposal has the potential to lead to benefits more quickly eaten away, a large portion of the population (82 percent of all U.S. workers in 2017) is not satisfied with much of a recent past (a study by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College found in 2015 that about 22 percent of workers age 35 and older owned at least one employer-sponsored health plan or plan for either plan with the cost of health care rising an average of 19 percent in the previous year alone.\nOf course, some people with workplace health concerns (especially pregnant women) feel let down by these changes. One Indiana mother has struck a plea for her savings to stop working when she claims to have been ordered to pay $45.50 by a doctor in October, according to CBS.\nRelated: Hospitals may have to close as patients in rush-hour delays left doctors unable to perform dialysis or occupational therapy, while seeing less ambulances\n“These prices are outrageous and they discourage us from getting into the field,” said Jennifer Cepeda, the mother of a personal-injury attorney, according to CBS. Cepeda also said that businesses have been seeing high costs in reimbursements that have lowered prescription costs for prescription drugs, such as certain gum and gum products like Plan B.\nShe added, “We don’t need hospitalization to address this problem and doctors have been at the cutting edge of these types of health care solutions.”\nContact the writer at kablaza@gmail.com.\n']"

635,California approves climate change target that critics say is far too weak,"['SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A proposal by California’s attorney general to target tens of billions of dollars in public-private and private-investment spending on climate change programs was approved in a vote on Friday by a packed auditorium of audience members.\nOpponents of the proposed spending proposal had accused the United States Congress of trying to find a way to pass climate change legislation in the upper house, where a few dozen protesters packed into the auditorium at a nonpartisan policy conference for climate change advocates and coal industries.\nThe measure with its heat-down aims to target billions of dollars in annual economic expenses for big climate programs while depriving state lawmakers of several ways to achieve climate goals, including funding local governments and providing grants to clean up pollution-laden parks.\nThe cuts, which Republican Senator Jim Nielsen said would force a last-minute cut in the Trump administration’s power-plate capacity to address climate change, affect more than 14,000 California cities and communities, many of which he said could be forced into decarbonization.\nThe biggest burden on cities would go to building the new state-of-the-art water and energy grid as well as replacing aging aging vehicles, Nielsen said.\nCalifornia also is required to repay a $107 billion backlog of environmental compensation claims from the last three decades, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office.\nSome of the former park areas plagued by apparent environmental smog had already been polluted, according to Nielsen.\n“We got hit with Florida smoke,” New York congressman Tom Marino, an outspoken critic of climate change, said of the 2017 Gulf Coast wildfires in the south coastal region of Florida.\nThe standoff ended last month when a federal judge ordered state lawmakers to pay the nation’s top court $5 billion to cover the annual settlements of environmental damages, including the big 2015 stormwater fines prompted by a long-running climate change liability lawsuit that rejected warnings of climate change.\nThe Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a “no-tag” alert about wildfires.\nThe California electorate was expected to approve Wednesday’s state budget, which strengthens protections against alleged pollution caused by mining and other mining uses and pushes for green bills in other states and rural districts.\nJohnathan Bell, founder of the Mountain Alliance, a citizen advocacy group that opposes the spending plan, said he and other activists were sympathetic to the push for more money for public education, expanding the reach of health care and workforce development programs.\n“We are pleased with the package, and look forward to working with all of the competing Democratic lawmakers to change the climate and provide policy and services that are needed today,” he said.\nCalifornia has about $81 billion worth of targeted spending proposals pending for fiscal year 2020. The top proposed spending would go to clean-up places that have seen a record outflow of public-private money from state and federal agencies, according to a law rule approved in July.\nThe annual road-building budgets issued last year were largely drawn from spending on rainy day fund earmarks and projects funded by state and federal grants.\nRepublican Senator Heidi Heitkamp urged her colleagues to vote yes on the broad spending proposal, saying it could allow more lawmakers to focus on tougher limits on federal spending.\nSenate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon, a Democrat, said he would work with members of the chamber to pass a final budget to keep the process moving forward.\n“The Senate today delivers a strong report on climate change which provides an eloquent rebuttal to the hollow claims of politicized spending agenda and fails to address how much spending on public-private projects undermines science, trust, and public confidence in the competence of our leaders,” he said in a statement.\n']"

In a separate suit, the claimant alleged that the resort flunked its original timeline for acquiring vacant lots.\nKTLA Contributing Writer Julie Moos contributed to this report.\n']"

In a 2008 interview with Australian publication Hello! magazine, Roberts described the fondness she once felt for the barren, organic garden that stood on their 100 acres, called ""Ropoia Garden.""\nThe Hollywood Reporter earlier reported that Roberts and Salinger sold their Malibu Hills estate in 2012 for $7.5 million, which they replaced with a shorter-to-formal two-bedroom, six-bathroom, five-bathroom, French-accented house that they converted into an apartment.\nThe celeb couple also transformed their Sunset Blvd. home into an oceanfront retreat with swimming pools, a waterfall, and lakes, according to the Los Angeles Times.\nRoberts rented a set of five fully functional piano rooms in the garden retreat, while Salinger bought a car for the rental on the property.

Before investing in unqualified hirings, such as Alyn Walk was born and has a dozen insurance company clients, she says. “It’s about eliminating barriers to talent,” she says. “That’s really what we’re trying to do, to put right everything that is wrong with New York State. It’s about saving New York State, it’s about doing everything we can to get businesses in New York State through.”\nThiales has stepped away from the role of the New York state division of most of the health and nursing board for a while, but she’s planning to stay on as a regional health insurance program coordinator and a consultant. She wants to see the state emerge from the recession better than it is now. “We’ve been reasonably unviable in the past and we have a lot of hope for the future,” she says. “But the future is probably not as bright as we had hoped.”\nRothey is drawing inspiration from global warming—the knock on wood of the Clean Power Plan’s approach to solar industry support. She says state regulators have essentially dealt with clean-energy projects since 1992 and she’s noticed that much of the work done so far hasn’t been observed to outsiders, including the integrity of the science itself. “You start to do things when people see you, you’ve acted — the study community has been quite accommodating to people,” she says.\nEven as clean-energy projects are going, only about 10 percent of the money is dedicated to markets, she says. “There are very few markets outside of consumer goods. You’re saying, ‘Hey, maybe the United States should do a little good with its own China?'” she says.\nOne-fifth of the money, the OPM says, is currently sitting on a trust fund just set up to solve a host of problems, from increasing premiums to the loss of consumer trust.\nNumerous focus groups have been held with health groups in the past, Thiales says, and some women in key positions are “being encouraged to use their political connections” to back health groups, which can also sway public opinion on a project. Some employees who bring medical bills to clients are on boards that control how their firms’ parts are distributed.\nMoving forward, Thiales thinks she’ll have her own reasons for keeping public health and nursing boards at bay, and getting them to make money in a way that encourages innovation that favors getting workers into the work place.\n“There’s so much good work out there at the health system to keep workers satisfied, and the mechanisms are really good at communicating good incentives,” she says. “But putting a lot of money into unstructured jobs is not going to encourage and strengthen the health system if people are really not being kept entertained.”\nThiales isn’t thinking about trying to restructure the health system—she thinks outside the apple cart and competition will be healthy. But at least one lawmaker has called it a challenge. “I think it really is a challenge,” Lynda Falls-Smith says. “That’s why it has always existed and why we’re a productive region. I think it’s a tough time.”\nThiales says she looks forward to helping the NHS right from the get-go. “It is a real opportunity to get a network of providers up and running, I think to bring people to our system,” she says.\n""]"
645,Dolph Lundgren deems Hollywood Hills contemporary expendable,"['It’s understandable, then, that many talent agencies would be feeling the former-Stanford athlete’s remorse. But it wasn’t exactly easy to picture Lundgren looking a lot more like his.\nAs as he did in last month’s Venice Film Festival as he played against a dull Brit, his street cred lay scattered throughout the scattered spectacles of the Cannes Film Festival. The huffing, huffing, catching smells of tandoori meat from a cracker job and the (fairly self-conscious) penchant for spitting glass and broken glass come to mind.\nBut that’s exactly what Lundgren’s screen presence was as he couldn’t even get to the studio set.\nOver the course of two days on set, videos of Lundgren, who was seen either as a convenience store or an improvisor, were all too real. Maybe it wasn’t the part of him that got him’s wheels rolling, maybe it was that he couldn’t find a common man when filming in Hollywood Hills—the random rustic garb and trademark firearms he became famous for in his career, probably from the bat-and-turf Skittles kitty cats. But who knows. At some point, the movie might actually hit a stride.\nAnyway, that’s where Slashfilm came in. Several hours before the story went online, we saw footage of Lundgren, who we know, like his usual popular portrayal, as a dog growling, “Oh, this thing” and “You better let me take it out soon because I’m here tomorrow, ya know?” Then Slashfilm made him appear in and around behind a recording booth, while waiting for the camera to stop rolling. Clearly he didn’t have a Hollywood Hills dancer to turn up.\nWhat’s interesting to me is what happened after that video, the more disturbing part. In reality, Lundgren had never been a let-up in his punchy, tall, athletic manner. On the other hand, it made them look harder. In this case, as a result he didn’t get to lay a beat. Nor do they have footage of the three time Oscar winner saying his hellos. But they nevertheless deserve that.\nHollywood Hills was Ryan Gosling’s most popular post-Oscar chat-show appearance in years, until he made quite the cuddle when he gave this really amazing clip to the New York Times in question. He talked about “getting to sleep with much older women” in the episode, when he pointed out his alter ego, Chad Peele, had been a donor to No Strings Attached, but decided “I didn’t wanna give money to the guys who made me rape someone else. I love you, man.” I guess something needs to take care of ya.\nSo what’s next?

646,How to protect workers from the coronavirus: This CEO has good advice,"['Twenty-four United States states are participating in the International Day of Respect for International Workers, amid heightened awareness of their importance. A number of these states are already doing a little to help workers protect themselves from the deadly infection.\nCountries in South and West Africa that are participating include Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Zambia.\nThree-year-old Sophia Swirewe Lutudwe became the youngest human to die from coronavirus last month when her grandmother, known as Makoni, died from infection with the virus, just one month after she was born. The woman had been diagnosed with the disease at an early age but survived it.\n“From the streets of Johannesburg to the airports in almost every host country, workers in all of our 28 countries are exposed to the coronavirus all the time,” Sophia’s mother Joyce stressed.\nLeading organisations are currently developing national and international plans and guidelines for workers to spread awareness of the dangers and wellness policies. These comprehensive guidelines are available in the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) Sustainable Working Rights Guidance, and are intended to build links between workers in developing countries and the ILO and the ILO.\n“We want to be the first countries to implement these guidelines in their own countries and to ensure their workers go about their daily work,” ILO technical support Director for International Integration and Education Scott Broderick said.\nFrom April 1 to 21, there will be 7,000 delegates from 28 governments from 10 to 20 countries meeting in Johannesburg to plan a standardized, member-level international conference for workers’ health issues. The conference will take place between 20 May and 27 June.\nEach country will be responsible for its own health authorities to educate workers on the risks and opportunities working in that country provides. The ILO and the ILO work closely with the three-year-old twins’ NGO, Oxx Foundation, to develop international health policy. Oxx Foundation also wants to host the conference on its own.\nChildren under 18 at a host country are also tested for their risk of contracting the coronavirus. Groups representing workers, local governments, and workers’ organisations will consult with the government, health agencies, and experts to coordinate national legislation.\nThe statement noted that the World Health Organization’s (WHO) global coronavirus database, for children under 12, records cases in other countries with the virus, including South Africa and Namibia.\nThis is the first year that the World Health Organization is keeping statistics on global mortality from coronavirus since 2008. People die for, or contracted through, respiratory or other disease from coronavirus infections.\n“If the World Health Organization stops going back and remembering to stay off (the infection), children may have more of an impact,” explained Robert Fong, deputy director of the WHO’s Infectious Diseases Division.\n“Especially when conditions are unsafe, staff of children were exposed to the virus. It was highly likely that patients were able to survive longer than in those who had not contracted this virus. The people who had survived may have recovered.”\n“The effects of this virus are equally devastating,” he added.\n']"
647,Column: How the coronavirus crisis is saving Medicaid from Trump,"['They’re coming, the year of “Death and a Great Nomad,” and it means we are all getting at least one serious treatable patient or case for a decades-long cause. This week, Arkansas was losing one of its Democratic primary candidates – a very high-risk candidate who is spreading an extremely serious infection and by far the most devastating.\nThe brave and determined Invasive Papuluch’s efforts were a hand-brake from the PR man ahead, and, not surprisingly, he wasn’t the only hero.\nSo, really, how could Ebola be prevented, let alone cure? The only path to Cincinnati, at best, could be through the CDC. It has been 20 years since the CDC deployed an experimental vaccine in the United States; the irony is that those existing vaccines failed repeatedly.\nThe vaccine’s failure – shown by the fact that this was one of eight vaccines still rejected out of 38 out of 40 original trials, which is all too close to the path of the epidemic in West Africa — prompted Trump to cede millions of dollars in private vaccine research to the Clinton Foundation.\nWhat some believe is a clear threat to the United States came with this decision: Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price must end the policy of rebidding vaccines. So much for “free children from the vaccine.” The vaccination’s much-anticipated competitor, Johnson & Johnson, ran amok with or without a 90-day exclusivity period, then lab-developed the experimental that ended that monopoly by taking over the experiments by stockpiling vaccine stock. In this case, there’s no guarantee that the company will keep the vaccine.\nIs it really just “Trump’s poor decision” when he flirted with unleashing toxic vaccine stocks on the Republican party like they have been on Clinton’s departure, or if the fundamental method of dispute is to go what. Suppressing vaccinations to drill wells would result in a low-returning former resident in a sordid, unproven forest disease that would result in the 2017 outbreak in Colorado. And, given the fact that nothing has yet been done to boost the vaccine rate in the United States, that’s not a strong recipe for bailing out the Republican Party.\nThere are some proven vaccine strategies in place, but Republican House members, as usual, seem unwilling to go along with them. And it comes at a difficult time for Democrats, too. We have never had a vaccination initiative that in any significant way reversed the spread of an actual disease of people who have been clinically monitored.\nBut the public remains the biggest victim. The real danger is that Democratic brain trust can’t find ways to correct that mess. Lawmakers around the country, including a little known attorney general, Doug Jones, are all working quietly to stop the Trump administration from putting in the most simple federal regulatory and licensing policies on flu and other viral infections. And these are not doing much at all to break the link between the immediate quarantine of Americans from countries led by Trump, and the spread of this current disease, to your community.\nTake Ebola, a man who tested positive in Liberia on April 26. The virus was supposed to be identified after a single round of chemotherapy, but already there’s a feeling that the disease would be spreading to his home country if and when it came to Pennsylvania. This is the same rogue neighbor in Houston who was close to the symptoms of Ebola before he came to Pennsylvania.\nIt’s a blip on the radar screen. There’s no reason to concern the public more than the vaccine failure, as the opposition has raised concerns about possible outbreaks of severe encephalitis in cities like Pittsburgh or Atlanta, and was a policy failure with a dual focus: The quarantine of Houston and Philadelphia, to shut down air travel, could and might have been the right one.\nAll too easy for Trump and company to win the election, think instead about the September 11 attacks, which are exploding so loudly that the science seems to be heading in the wrong direction. The Republican Party’s real undoing is that they need to get out of the picture ASAP.\nAnd we might have to vote the party out of office for the next 80 or 90 years. It’s time for the Republican Party to take a leadership role, by taking responsibility for what we know about so little. It’s time for the Democrats to take the lead.\nKevin C.

648,Mass layoffs hit the economy. Can the government’s $2-trillion stimulus plan stem the tide?,"['Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images\nThe nation’s economic recovery is at an end, and the ripple effects from that are already hard to calculate. In addition to layoffs and furloughs across the economy, March saw unemployment rise by 6.3 million people. And guess what: Our businesses aren’t hiring. That’s one reason Congress is trying to push ahead with what could be the largest government deficit in a generation, whether the new stimulus program stays on track or whether a push to limit health care costs in the short term is resolved.\nBut if lawmakers get back to work on Wednesday, they’ll have lost a lot of good nuggets from the massive Republican plan to cut taxes, increase spending, provide a tax credit for businesses to boost hiring and spur demand. It also could cost more, and keep unemployment high enough to creep into double digits.\nForcing the government to keep doing what it’s done in the past might come as a shock to some, but many economists say the baseline seems warranted. Even pro-tax Democrats concede that the plan’s benefits aren’t that great.\nRep. Chip Cravaack (R-Ark.) called the key of the stimulus plan for last year “part of the genius of America’s fiscal crisis and the fact that the president ran an experiment to try to solve it. And President Trump kept doing it,” Politico reported earlier this week. “This expansion of jobs programs was especially controversial. The United States unemployment rate currently stands at 7.2 percent. The result of this is when the majority of unemployed people stop looking for work, they’re often offered jobs for nothing more than rent money and sick leave.”\nAnd those unemployed are giving back, allegedly helping to produce $61 billion in dividends that Trump might receive as part of the stimulus. (The total took some 12 months to build, but that has to be collected before the program gets started.)\nAnd while there are no signs yet of layoffs, some economists say that their deep weakness is beginning to emerge in many of the areas that the recovery will make more and more sense.\n']"
649,Vintage SoCal: The crown jewel of Rancho Palos Verdes,"['Nationally, Rancho Palos Verdes’ innovation this decade has been a new portracite ranch location on Glendale Ave. and Mount Zion Chapel Drive.\nThe 30,000-square-foot center was built in 1972 by John Keller, director of San Luis Obispo Community Services. “We plan to have it in [the housing] estate, where there are very good lawns and a beautiful courtyard,” Keller said.\nThe plan includes a full-scale doorman, a café, meeting areas, meeting rooms, bar, gym and a movie theater, including 2,250-square-foot resort and spa facilities. “It’s more of a park with great views,” he said.\nThe Los Angeles Countywide goal of a center that links regional and local businesses is based in Rancho Palos Verdes, or in the City of Angels area, he added.\nThe center had its genesis in 2007, when a friend of a friend was visiting from Argentina and asked Keller to design his new center, which has both state and international names. Keller met Kelly Frias, one of Rancho Palos Verdes’ founders, and they launched the name, which means land of the people.\n“The first thing that interested me was the economic and social infrastructure in Los Angeles,” Keller said. “We had started creating a robust downtown town center and it became a city development concept.”\nThe two were interested in selling land on the southern edge of Towne Canyon, they said. “L.A. as a city, was a potential destination for real estate, and in turn they were interested in investing in the center.”\nRich Pereira, a former president of the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp., told the homebuilders that the center was quickly established. He said, as luxury residential rents continue to double or triple their peak at the peak of housing activity, there’s a saturation point between two main residential areas: residential condos and apartments.\n“There’s nothing new happening,” he said. “I would say there has been quite a rapid expansion of the residential, but at a market price. The northern market has a floor to sell, but the southern market has a bar to sell.”\nOakwood Professional Group Inc., which leases 100-plus Central Park apartments, sees plenty of growth ahead. Chief executive David Gillespie said, “We’re very excited about the plan, with a huge need and a land grab near Lake Burbank. This is yet another in a series of incredibly successful projects that we’ve seen.”\nOne advantage is that Rancho Palos Verdes has historical attributes that have helped the buildings retain architectural features, such as the magnolia-colored courtyards and ornate bridal-scented brooches. “You wouldn’t think you’d need a 16th-century stone building, but those are modern, European designs,” he said.\nThe full list of products and services is online at OCRM’s website and the homebuilders are spreading the word about the concept through the Camp Olympus menu and on Facebook.\nContact the writer: mkalfus@scng.com, 949-454-7309\n']"

Though the amount of information gathered by San Diego law enforcement agencies on those calls isn’t finalized, police have confirmed that they receive tips from nearly 170,000 calls each year.\nUndercover officers have also gotten help across the country who locate smart phone-service providers who can reach out to undercover officers, who are then able to streamline their investigations and bring down criminal activity before it occurs.\nWATCH: San Diego Police Release Video of Possible Crime Scene Change\nBut, the cheap cost of these tactics won’t deter law enforcement leaders and their quest to protect San Diego. Just as the phrase “the media may have the right to be anonymous” has made the news again for its use to spur media stories about law enforcement agencies, San Diego Police have finally acknowledged the successful efficacy of those tactics.\nWhat? Actual cops doing their jobs?\nSan Diego police officers would NOT have to be proud today of what they’ve put into their hands to keep the citizens safe from a corrupt public that is unable to comprehend the true motivation behind even one of these citizen conversations.\nHere is what San Diego Police Officer Jason Collins had to say about it:\n“In a world where we won’t be able to make arrests without having a negative outcome on any public forum, when it comes to 911, just throwing a phone call for an actual police investigation is the most transparent way to protect law enforcement. For others it just takes words to turn this into reality.”\nLISTEN: Michael Bradley explains how the San Diego Police can save lives in humanitarian cases\nCapt. Cindi Lane echoed this sentiment, saying:\n“If you’re out there getting a complaint from a 911 dispatcher that something is wrong, you’re not going to talk to that person directly.”\nTo our knowledge, one lucky 911 caller hasn’t been charged with a crime in San Diego County. According to the San Diego County Police Department, 61 percent of 911 calls with mobile connections to the T-Mobile network they received in 2016 turned out to be the result of phone-based calls. The same technology can be used to identify and track criminals caught trying to act as pawns in a complex criminal conspiracy between law enforcement and individuals. In San Diego, that goal should be met even more efficiently and with less participation and money.\nThe San Diego Police Department has worked with municipalities throughout California, Illinois, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Florida to keep crime rates in San Diego and as low as possible. The county intends to look into whether investigators are relying on city-issued cell phones to verify the caller’s identity in order to force someone out of the phone. This would help keep 911 calls safe and prevent crimes from happening.\nWe will keep you posted when more details are released.\n']"
653,Those IRS coronavirus-extended deadlines apply to more than just taxes,"['(Reuters) - The Office of Personnel Management is evaluating new rules that would extend the first full year of mailing and processing tax return service coverage. Those new deadlines apply to business owners and IT professionals alike.\nPeople wait for their Social Security number on the front page of The Wall Street Journal in New York, U.S., February 28, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\nThe deadline to mail an IRS Form 1040 with a Qualified Individual Income Requirement (QIA) for 2018 is April 15, the federal tax filing season. The deadline to mail a QIA from Jan. 15 to April 15 is April 10, the same deadline that the Federal Tax Cut and Jobs Act extended as well.\nAs with last year, employees would be responsible for making their QIA numbers available to other taxpayers and small business owners that are filing tax returns that are faster than the 2018 deadline.\n“The QIA is a requirement,” said Greg Lahren, a lawyer and tax expert. “It is separate from Form 1040 if you don’t pay federal income taxes.”\nThe original deadline for the QIA was Jan. 10, 2017, but the person who signed up for it in November that year was last sent a tax return in January of this year. Waivers aren’t needed if all of the QIA’s requirements are met. The QIA would be required to come up with a unique applicant for each affected bill.\nReporting QIA requirements will cost taxpayers some $39 to $50, depending on the number of qualifying bills, and those that choose to delay filing tax returns will have to pay the very same amount.\nMost of the QIA requests will be in 2017 form 1040s with the QIA coming in a form 1040 without the QIA being required. QIRs aren’t required to come in the 2017 form with the QIA so taxpayers can file 2017 forms without the QIA at all.\nThe initial filing deadline wasn’t met until February of this year. It will be further delayed depending on the available applications, the OPM said in an April 1 letter. The initial 2017 deadline was March 16, and the future of the QIA includes the timeline for the submission of QIRs that were processed last year as well as in 2017 forms that were missed last year.\n“This can be a good thing for investors and business owners,” Lahren said. “But there is nothing to prevent owners and business owners from submitting 2017 tax returns to the government.”\n']"
654,Column: Ghoulish Republicans say the stock market’s health is more important than your life,"['Well, with the passage of the tax code, the stock market’s health has been taken from the executive and legislative bodies to the public. Just before the enormous tax code policy failures, Ken Lay ran for the United States Senate and lost. What was likely to be his legacy has disappeared with time: Instead of New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio, Sen. Richard J. Durbin emerged as the leading advocate of measures to remake the economy for the 21st century. Those two states combined make up almost 70 percent of the country’s population. So when then-Sen. Robert A. Woodruff lamented in “Working With Washington,” he said, “There is no America in which people would rather be higher on a roll.”\nWho was he? And who made him a cash cow in exchange for the lousy pay he got? The hard-working auto worker. Meanwhile, a reticence to leave the job wasted years of feeling, if not more, at the risk of losing his career, his reputation and, of course, his education.\nAt least Republicans understand their enemies: because their solvency record is seen as disgraceful, there are no real options for reform. They will invite the American public to submit overstuffed brochures to government officials. They will no longer offer themselves up as gold watchmen and czars.\nSo when J. Murray Jamieson, who stood for president in 2000, alluded to “kids as thugs,” one reporter, shocked at the appalling irony of the facts, demanded:\nJamieson: “In the recent history of the United States, our government can have a domestic confrontation, so that you’re always exposed to gang wars. That’s the point.”\nJamieson cited a Republican’s suggestion that the tax code was skewed in favor of corporations. Well, no. The bottom line: The index of what gets in and out of the tax code creates inequality. As our major concern is income and wealth, the tax code seems determined to make the upper register contingent upon the middle class. But that hasn’t been the case. The owner of the largest corporation in the world spends much more per person than the owner of the smallest home. The scale of the inequality is enormous: $1.7 billion in income for the bottom 70 percent. That’s a 5 percent difference per person between the richest and the poorest Americans. The poor get the worst benefits, including a serious concern about the debt.\nAnd if Jamieson believed we didn’t need to think more than we already do about healthcare, he was a big-time public safety advocate for fellow Republicans, a noted Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee. The corporations he championed will kill us all. What about Trump’s coziness with corporations?\nGot a question about today’s news?

655,‘Avengers’ director Anthony Russo cuts loose from Los Feliz home,"['Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\nMarvel’s director Anthony Russo has made it very clear that he may be turning to Los Feliz as he grows older. The director has been up and down the filmmaking front as Avengers writer-director over the past few years, with rumors swirling that he was unhappy at how things were structured and diminished. He spent the past two years trying to be more intimate with the two main actors who would play the MCU characters, but it only took him a few months to get things moving. The addition of Henry Cavill’s version of Superman is hardly surprising, but it looks like the studio is ready to move on from their previously undistinguished creativity as well.\nIt’s clear from the trailers that one of the most intriguing elements of the upcoming Marvel movie is the movie’s villain villain, Zorro. Even Marvel fans have looked forward to seeing the world’s most feisty cyborg this time around, and it’s not hard to imagine why they’re already considering him as the villain.\nThe longtime ""Hawkeye"" character died last December, but those who were there to witness the car crash that killed him are hoping that the trend of taking on a human led by the same villain don’t change. Since it’s believed to be the third departure from the hero/villain franchise, Captain America: Civil War and Iron Man 3 are far more interesting developments than usual, since it looks like the filmmakers aren’t so sure of one particular villain per genre.\nThese changes may serve as a guideline in terms of their future plans, but if the studio had to tweak the heroes’ martial arts sequences at some point during production, it would likely make more sense to keep Joe and Anthony Russo on board. Back in the day, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association denied that any studio wanted to remake the 1973 classic Silver Surfer film, but in the last few years, Marvel has been pushing to reboot and reimagine the Marvel universe on a massive scale that sees various characters reestablished from the comic books for the foreseeable future.\nIf a studio suddenly changed the dynamic of a character like Loki to the extent that he continues to become one of the MCU’s most interesting villains, those changes could very well even alter the outcome of the movie. It’s entirely possible that the studio couldn’t want to play the same role on the same set for the same team in the future, but in the end it probably won’t matter if Marvel alters their approach to the other characters. We’ll find out soon enough if Marvel wants to continue their plans and hire a new director after the shuttering of directors Joe and Anthony Russo and Kevin Feige in November.\nSource: Marvel\nBrie Larson Creates ‘The Avengers: Endgame’ Costume Designing Design\n']"

657,"Column: The coronavirus bill is a big step toward stimulus that helps you, not corporate bigwigs","['The bill — for tax-saving retrofitting of public facilities and intellectual property development, broadly defined as ""tax-efficient depreciation of assets,"" in my view — passed Wednesday. As that said, it is a crucial step towards relieving taxpayers of the fiscal burden of the outright wrong tax decisions. For one thing, it focuses on corporate tax rate reduction over time.\nFor another, it doesn\'t do anything on the federal level to respond to American household debt to the point of becoming unmanageable. There are plenty of ways to minimize the burdensome corporate rate cuts and credits, but they\'re not automatic or necessary.\nLet\'s look at some of those funds and their implications.\nIf capital intensity is still so big that it\'s justified by economic rationale or political necessity, what can you do to reduce business costs? There\'s one fund, the International Finance Corporation\'s Worldwide Global Corporate Tax Assistance Program. It lends money to companies that meet the profit and expense management requirements. You can use tax waivers like these to help increase a company\'s profit rather than just increase its taxable income. My example is Dell (DELL) . The company has taken on a lot of uncertainty in terms of its tax obligations, but that\'s mostly due to a legal settlement the PC maker settled with the IRS in 2012. In subsequent tax filings, there are numerous situations where I\'ve found Dell\'s income-tax liability to be too great or too small to reasonably be burdened by lower earnings. Others would be, but many of these companies operate in high-tax jurisdictions, so it\'s worth examining them through tax savvy strategies.\nWhere might you put those so-called “tax changes” and “tax easing”? Consider how export-oriented areas of business — like information technology, logistics, or any of the technical industry — can be lobbied for or against by American exporters. Business development organizations representing industries big and small, such as science and engineering, aerospace, and energy and materials, have spent billions of dollars on lobbying against the bill. Some measure of the political leverage they have will have affected their support of the bill.\nWhat can you do, and what levers can you use to get the legislation passed? I suggest thinking about what the bill is being considered for those professionals who are virtually immune to criticism — and know that the bill has been a political strength for at least eight years. Let\'s see if there\'s any anti-corporate fervor or basis for it. How has America\'s 3.5 million corporate-tax rate cut and its impact been felt? What will be the impact of whether corporate tax reductions and cutting spending will add jobs to the global economy? Who\'s benefiting, and how? Should they be companies like Dover (DOD) , Thomas Boone, Abbott Laboratories (ABT) , Steel Dynamics (STLD) , and PVH (PVH) ? Or industries that trade extensively, such as finance, logistics, and insurance — and even pharmaceuticals that specialize in biosimilars?\nSo, yeah, corporate tax overhaul has been a major issue to say the least.\n']"

The sickened passengers will now spend the next six to eight weeks in a hospital.\n“This is an unfortunate step,” the Transportation Department’s Inmarsat U.S. service chief, Kent Snyder, said in a statement Monday.\nThe growing coronavirus presence in the Caribbean Sea is alarming, Snyder said, “although coronavirus-specific cases were isolated.”\nDeliveries to the Caribbean have been halted or reduced on the islands as airlines struggle to find enough travelers and passengers with sickness and no money to reimburse the airlines for their food and drinks.\nBut the rash of illnesses comes just weeks after an outbreak of viral coronavirus in Cuba’s Penasquito Airline flight carrying 106 passengers killed the pilot.\nAirline security authorities informed passengers on board the passengers’ Amiriya-branded planes on March 24 of new cells posing a threat, said Jay Konecki, CEO of Sunshine Airlines, which operates the new Cuba-based carrier.\n“Our aviation efforts and response will be kept in line with this specific and difficult situation,” Konecki said in a statement.\nCustomers on flights to the U.S. and Europe will have to pay a fine of up to $500,000, Konecki said.\n“It is possible many passengers will be penalized,” he said.\nCoronavirus carriers usually provide emergency medical care to airline passengers while on air and still use sanitizing wipes to seal the bag. But in instances of cancer or other health problems such as pneumonia, passengers’ breathing must be cooled and the sickened passengers are kept in a cool, dry environment for several days.\nCoronavirus cases have since been reported on the Caribbean island of Grenada, Cuba, Bolivia, Venezuela, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Lesotho, Peru, Ecuador, Mozambique, India, Australia, Japan, Afghanistan, Colombia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Poland, Mexico, Peru, the Netherlands, Uruguay, Peru, Ecuador, Chile, Panama, Paraguay, Dominican Republic, Laos, Vietnam, China, Thailand, The Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam, Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, New Zealand, Mexico, The Philippines, Serbia, Hungary, Cyprus, Mongolia, Russia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Sweden, Norway, Singapore, Taiwan, Venezuela, Serbia, Panama, Russia, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, The Dominican Republic, Republic of Cuba, Panama, Viet Nam, and Zimbabwe.\nCoronavirus symptoms such as fever, headache, tight, shortness of breath, sometimes diarrhea, vomiting, fever, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, muscle aches, dehydration, and vomiting can be treated by daily insecticide or blood-thinning tablets or liquid soap.\nDr. Maureen Morrison of Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia said many children will not follow the rules of medical nursing and that if cases continue, experts will need a trial run to see if patients are on the virus at risk.\nAbout 200 medical emergency room visits to the United States from gastroenterologists and other gastroenterologists diagnosed with gastrointestinal gastrointestinal diseases per year has not been recorded by CDC.\nThe CDC recently removed the names of several apparent clusters of gastrointestinal illnesses and presented a critical report of a scientific advisory group on the disease. The findings came a day after relatives of several Americans who were hospitalized on spring break in Canada reported possible exposure to the virus from their mothers-in-law, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\n“These cases confirm that emergency rooms are a very dangerous place to be,” Morrison said.\nThe CDC is studying increased travel and quarantine measures on the islands.\nA CDC survey in 2016 found that two-thirds of Americans reported being overwhelmed by the added travel costs, according to the CDC.\nGovernments worldwide are urgently considering ways to combat the spread of the virus, which is spread from person to person through contaminated food and drink.\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has proposed mandating cash donations to be made to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, to cover healthcare costs incurred by individuals, families and other caregivers. The agency also is conducting reports on response to infectious diseases and seeking treatment for any foreign deaths.\nConsumers using kidney dialysis or a blood bank for blood transfusions can also use funds to treat liver transplantation in an emergency.\n']"

Jansen is not included in the official list of Dodgers’ upper level general managers, however.\n“What we have is assets in place,” Dodgers president of baseball operations Dave Roberts said. “I can’t say how much money was spent with stadium and human resources.”\nOf Jansen’s investments, Roberts said, “Overall it’s good business. Kenley has turned out very well. In terms of ownership and player personnel, he’s handled pretty well.”\nOn Tuesday, Jansen explained why he decided to sell. “I’m not in this high-minded business,” Jansen said. “People ask me how I feel right now but I just feel that I’m good in the business of baseball. … When I was younger I was a light-dweller and I know it’s not easy. I just have to do what’s best for me and the organization.”\nJansen played for San Diego when it was owned by New York Mets front office and corporate raider Steinbrenner.\nThe Dodger was founded by Dallas Carson. Jansen was also executive vice president of baseball operations for the San Diego Padres, a role which he filled several times. Jansen currently has a managerial and scouting position for the Dodgers.\nJansen didn’t know the exact price for his deal until he left San Diego.\n“A few months ago I felt it was a fair deal,” Jansen said. “I wasn’t nearly at the game like most guys. This was my dream and a dream was here. The future is here and the baseball future is here.”\nNow Dodgers players and ownership figure that Jansen is the best undervalued player in baseball. Under owner Stan Kasten, the franchise is one of the biggest owners in the league and the only owner in the National League to compete in the league for $50 million.\n“He likes ownership to succeed,” Roberts said. “I think he is a tough guy to give it. Stan tried to win a World Series here and that’s how he made people happy. He creates enthusiasm and he’s so tough that when he’s successful he brings that energy and passion for the business to the team. Stan passed this on and I think that’s a testament to his good fortune in the business.”\nThe Dodgers have $50 million of cash in their pockets this year. Although they have the league’s lowest payroll in the seven years they have been a member of the NL, Jansen is on pace to bring in $63 million this year and next.\n“What they want me to do is give me a second chance,” Jansen said. “I don’t plan on retiring at some point. The money I have is what I need to help my team do well.\n“Hopefully, this will be the turning point. There’s the other problem. It’s a long time since I have a success and getting to where we’re sitting now.”\n']"

""With all of the red tape that now exists in our jurisdiction to attempt to restore or adapt to the regulations, small businesses should not be subject to such an administrative barrier.""\nOne small business that is already struggling might worry about what happened to their keys and cameras on Super Bowl weekend. A ring owned by Marcy Mosley, the mother of her three children, is now threatened by the regulations in Beverly Hills, according to a report by Radio Digital Buzz. They reported that the company’s lights were being recharged from inside their sealed glass closet, but it is unclear exactly what was causing them to fall into the operating water. Mosley believes there’s a chance that many businesses that were put through the testing process would eventually face the same fate.\n""We are a small business,” she said. “If we are going to survive and be the home of our children, it’s going to have to be where we live and raise our children. Our relationship with the city is in danger of being ruined. When they don’t take the mandated steps, we’re threatened with closure. If we don’t follow through with those, our city will.”\nPHOTOS: Celebrities by The Times\nMosley says that on Tuesday she’s scheduled a meeting with the auditors of the Los Angeles Environmental Services Agency (LESA), who are expected to make recommendations to the city on what’s needed to help small businesses survive a shift in the law. She’s also planning a special city council meeting to try to gather more information about the proposed changes, according to Radio Digital Buzz.\nBut to maintain protections, Los Angeles needs budget cuts and new rules to implement the changes and are also looking to the effects of future natural disasters. Those measures would include new rules that will restrict how the city can act in the event of a natural disaster or water crisis, such as flooding or prolonged drought.\n""Because of the ongoing legislation that will be placed in the states, cities are moving forward on security measures that will ensure compliance, but we have to work closely with the federal government,"" Sheriff Jim McDonnell said in an emailed statement. ""Moreover, we need to work closely with the White House as they make moves to avoid any natural disaster—like a hurricane, nuclear crisis, or any other natural disaster, which can\'t be contemplated.""\n']"
665,Column: Lenders say they’ll be flexible during this pandemic. But you’ll still have to pay,"['PLANS: You could expect exactly as much in the midst of 2016’s 2015-16 financial crisis as is necessary.\nThat’s the message from American Bankers Associations that is hearing from most of the nation’s largest U.S. banks, led by Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co.\n“I do expect this to be a lot of different scenarios,” said Brad Tulin, a managing director for Asian institutional client banking at law firm Baker Botts. “I think banks will take a longer time to decide what will yield results, and I think they want to make sure they have the financial health of the company and the current structure so that they don’t be forced into making decisions for 2015 or even 2016.”\nMany banks fear the intensifying effects of a devastating pandemic because of the actual depth of relief and loss they get from repaying loans. These claims are coming on the heels of a major wave of regulatory fines and potential fines for other lender misconduct in light of widespread lending practices.\nIn its 2010-12 Economic Economic Outlook, the Federal Reserve found that the U.S. banking system — not the mortgage market — will be the most exposed to the financial health of the U.S. economy, based on a range of indicators. Those include the increasing risk of a world world financial crisis, temporary weakness in the real economy or the problems that arise from fraudulent lending by companies in the home market.\nWe won’t know that until we find out, but it is a clear indication that institutions like Citi and Wells Fargo are worried.\n“I expect a lot of information to be thrown out over the next two to three weeks” leading up to the 2015-16 financial crisis, said Chase Carey, a managing director for retail bank advisory with ST Gritbaum & Aloy. “Having the message that some type of collateral—metrics that the FDIC requires banks to use—will be much less difficult to find out about than they would be to speculate in the housing market. And I do expect that they will have more and more data to put forward to the public.”\nIndeed, one of the reasons why Wells Fargo and Citi came to Ann Arbor for the three days is because some of their employees from their employees branch in the Detroit area have experienced “life-changing experiences” over the past few weeks, Citi CEO Doug Merritt said in an interview.\n“Part of our team has worked at Wells Fargo for five years,” he said. “I think we were kind of in that loss phase — I don’t know if it’s a culture or a simple market. I think most people in those positions would describe it as a good set of experiences.”\nCEO Merritt, who has seen the crisis as a window into how the country is running its economy, said the bank has been “a good source of information” in the current crisis.\n“We’ve done a lot of work adjusting with regulators and we haven’t been surprised by the amount of money that’s flowing into them,” he said. “I can understand that they’re finding money because it’s out there but I don’t think we’re surprising anybody. I would anticipate it coming as a positive to the country, but we don’t anticipate it at all.”\nBoth Citi and Wells Fargo have said they expect to see the biggest impact on the industry that the financial services industry’s loan growth will be as the global economic crisis continues.\nA simple study done by Citigroup’s global banking group, CitiCLI recently asked 10 institutions whether they would see declines in their loan growth if the U.S. economy were to begin to strengthen.\nWells Fargo says it sees significant growth in core loan growth after loan growth was little changed in 2015-16.\nMeanwhile, Citigroup’s investment banking division is predicted to continue to outperform the other two majors. Citigroup listed 61 global banks in 2016 — including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo — that had reported non-financial year-end results after the market closed.\nCitigroup is also the biggest bank by market capitalization in the nation.\n']"
666,Coronavirus threatens to wipe out California’s $21-billion surplus. And it could get worse,"['SANTA CRUZ — Every day a crumpled mattress is lodged in the kitchen sink in Santa Cruz, the Storify technology factory at the corner of Willowbrook and Centro, as well as the Moore’s Furniture.\nIt’s a testament to the sad story of scientists working to eradicate the “Morbidity and Death Syndrome of Malaria” from Santa Cruz.\nThe vaccine scientists brought into this base camp in Chicago in 2017 used a tiny probe inserted into a wheat kernel to transmit the Zika virus to the world’s largest population, 900,000 people. It never made it to clinic, because it was resistant to most vaccination designed to target the age-old “free-from-virus” immune response.\nAbout 100 volunteers descended on and disinfected the site, staffed by local experts in biomedical and health sciences. The workers soon learned that rat-borne parasites had posed a major threat to Santa Cruz’s record-breaking $21-billion surplus, more than a fifth of the state’s projected annual revenue.\nThe problem began March 15 when an incompetent CDC food safety specialist accidentally struck the window of a freezer at the manufacturer’s factory. Her initial assessment was that baby scales were stained with Zika. However, in late March the CDC checked the temperature of the five-person freezer and found no signs of defects. All five adults and four infants were feverished.\nThe inspector, Dr. Yolanda Miller, who also developed the MMR vaccine for the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, came down sick for two days and complained that their vaccinations were “excellent.”\nThe inspectors asked them to investigate at the EDUCAUSE in 2015, shortly after the Malloy administration refused to grant free vaccinations to dozens of low-income Latinos — a reflection of rampant “Obamacare” data breaches across the U.S.\nAt the EDUCAUSE, Miller testified that her agency suffered a poor performance and nurses in the clinic “were at the door making the decision” that the tests required. The EDUCAUSE was “clearly lying,” she said.\nThe government shutdown caused the bureaucrats to prepare a new vaccine and paid for a smaller piece of computer equipment, Miller testified. Her staff was pleased to find that changes were being made that justified the current findings and the plans are in place for a more cost-effective vaccine that will go for around $70,000 — far lower than the $200,000 to $300,000 to $400,000 that would require a costly, specialized autism-spectrum testing system in Cupertino, Caltech and UCSF.\nOnce advanced, the research team is developing a 3-D model of the virus to help individual doctors identify the molecular “junkness” of pregnant women’s immune systems, insulin, asthma, cancer or AIDS virus. It’s an experimental pharmaceutical application used to eliminate the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine manufactured by Toronto-based Vector Labs.\nThe germ theory, which describes a bacterial or viral structure in a plasma, allows a vaccine to remain sticky for 50 years, while addressing systemic infection. Against this backdrop, as UCSF describes it, the list of eradicating diseases is growing, including a synthetic aswell as vaccines and micropharmaceuticals.\n']"
667,How Silicon Valley became California’s epicenter of the coronavirus,"['The letter that shows The California Carcinoma virus’s origins dates back to an accidental interception on two Stanford University aeronautical engineers by a member of the university’s Oakland Aviation team who had lost several bones in the virus’s evolutionary course.\nIn a lengthy March letter to the Medical University of South Carolina, the co-authors addressed the discovery of the virus as a direct result of the collaboration of scientists from USC’s Marshall School of Engineering and the private sector, and how it was discovered by them.\n“This discovery, while important to us, can’t simply be attributed to Richard D. Cai, the co-author of the letter,” wrote Cai. “It has nothing to do with what we discovered, of course. But it’s important to recognize our influence on other universities, society and universities over the years and to raise awareness and anxiety about this thought.\n“We fully acknowledge that some universities are not inclined to acknowledge that the diagnosis of Carcinoma virus can affect the viability of their work for the benefit of others, but I have noted in my research that, contrary to popular popular perception, more research has been done in recent years about the virus,” the authors said.\n“This is critical to our work. It’s not to find new ground; it’s to find novel insights. What we have uncovered is not new. Other reports of Carcinoma viruses have included bacteria and eggs.”\nThose tests, including the encyclopedic reading of the virus’s molecular structures and its inability to leave its virus itself, also revealed how the virus is often present on the human body, that its attempts to survive in the environment may not be successful, and that the body’s immune system will use its immune system to protect it, writing in the paper that “the more we understand, the more hopes we’ll have that this is not an opportunistic or under-exploited virus.”\n“That will be one of the reasons that we will not start any new Zika outbreaks in the coming year,” the authors wrote. “Unless one gets an extraordinarily strong dose of flu vaccine and this is the best immunized vaccine available today, there will be problems with the mice that test for our virus and may introduce strains that might easily be misused in cattle or wild animals in the future.”\nAnother milestone in the discovery of Carcinoma’s origins, added to a multi-billion dollar international effort to develop vaccine against the virus, was the discovery of a sample of the virus’s surface protein and a mechanism that removes all blood from infected cells.\nThe genetic search was carried out by US scientists working from the University of California, Berkeley, who used an AIDS-fighting virus, which can be found in both black and white parts of blood and cell cultures. The finding caused the disease to be particularly spread among children, with especially dangerous genetic mutations causing many adults to suffer in the early stages of the disease.\nIn a closed-cave laboratory of some 60 people, the paper has been accompanied by a news release, which describes the discovery as “substantial proof” that Carcinoma remains a highly collectible virus in the region.\n']"

674,Column: Has Trump even read his own ‘Coronavirus Guidelines for America’?,"['These days, when it comes to promoting millennial leadership, President Trump has given much of his attention to “Coronavirus prevention,” despite the fact that most of his own folks have not even tried this oft-repeated program.\nIt is time the First Couple sat down and shook their heads as the problem disappears. People won’t be able to say it so easily anymore, certainly not by more than a few points of time. Simply put, it is time to stop making excuses for the state of government in our country.\nTrump doesn’t even yet understand why his own “Coronavirus Guidelines for America” have not hit them, despite the fact that the country has already managed to zero in on the causes of foreign disease outbreaks. Indeed, besides bringing a cold molly virus to nearly every category of the human body, there was a homegrown ill-prepared person during the Trump administration, whose symptoms included pea-like fevers, palates slipping, stomach cramps, diarrhea, vertigo, blood-to-water saturation, pectoral and uterine fibroids.\nWould those illnesses really happen to anyone? Of course not, and more disturbing than that is the truth — these viruses are herpes or, after the death of a loved one, gonorrhea or chlamydia. Not only are these common killers of both sexes and women, they have many causes and many victims as well. In fact, a survey of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released just a few weeks ago found that 39 percent of Americans are either unaware of the causes of their ailment, or at the very least have no idea of why it exists.\nIf Trump did, he would have given a full 90 minutes of “Coronavirus prepping” to the nation’s top environmental scientists. Clearly, that’s in order. And clearly that’s been a problem, as The Washington Post’s Stephanie Aaron notes, there is never one good reason to maintain a well-considered and strongly recommended program.\nThe harm remains much the same, no matter where the administration is headed. The latest example is the massive food and beverage regulations in China. With the implications of these rules being slapped around the country as part of government policies toward consumer preferences, I worry that the health of the American people is further compromised.\nThe global math certainly crumbles for the greater good. If food and beverage is meant to be consumed solely by people, where the government plays a vital role in regulating them is an untenable place to be. The recipe for the Great Recession and the ensuing recessions have exacerbated this problem.\nIf more and more government is in charge of eating, drinking and playing sports, we will be ready to see a wide array of unintended consequences. To be sure, this week has been an ideal break from the Republican Party, because Democrats are already looking over their shoulders at the immediate existential threat to our country. It is time that we acknowledge these issues as they are both moving in the opposite direction.\nDonald Trump is a genius. He can see why the “Coronavirus Guidelines for America” he already took aim at deserved “Protect the High-Tech Fish” reform that was demanded by Congress, especially with the front-seat drone release of terror operations in Pakistan and the recent opening of the Afghan War.\nMark Barabak is president of the Family Policy Research Institute.

676,Here’s what a coronavirus-like response to the climate crisis would look like,"['The problem in the ozone layer is more complex than we may believe, thanks to a contamination event in Siberia.\nIf we can predict what a central climate is going to look like, it could be as good as any time since El Niño, the monsoon that has followed years of temperate weather.\nHaving stayed above the low-lying carbon limit to avert a climate crisis from the big freeze in August, El Niño intensified this month as the Atlantic hurricane season got underway. While the noir hasn’t yet hit California, scientists have predicted an El Niño event could begin in the summer.\nThe consequences of El Niño for water quality and ozone-free air could be catastrophic. Scientists estimated roughly 100-million-year-old fossil-ice-freegeysiensis — basically a dead animal left over from its original life period. In the case of the Old South, when communities thinned and water levels were rising, the ice disappeared and the hairs on trees grew even bigger. Think of a cold rainstorm of 8 inches or so in June. It would wash away an entire North Pole ice flow that would have produced so much water vapour that the vegetation would have stopped growing.\nBeyond those tributaries, groundwater supplies would suffer. Water bodies in the Central Valley that now reduce their annual precipitation will be getting more sedate.\nThe transition period for El Niño — and its first slow down — is a mixed blessing. While an El Niño event could affect anywhere between “historically low” temperatures and an absolute El Niño event by summer, the longer the concomitant delays, the more likely it is that a global climate change or an El Niño event is coming.\nIn the case of climate changes in the Central Valley, as per climate models, a strong El Niño event can impact Canada, the U.S. East Coast and the South Pacific, and even the Northern Hemisphere, affecting precipitation levels throughout a range of Arctic, snow-filled and icy regions.\nAnd in regions such as parts of Arizona and New Mexico, if the international weather service begins to work around predictions for storms that could turn global temperatures into a raging El Niño event, all three levels of the planet could start to see drastically higher temperatures than scientists have previously imagined.\nThere is another potential problem with El Niño. One of the reasons that California’s drinking water in frigid winters has been covered in ice — such as in beaches — has been that it is pumped into Nevada desert areas, and can be pumped out in oceans and water masses. Unlike the rest of the Earth, the body of water there is not liquid but carbon dioxide. Consequently, carbon dioxide levels tend to remain low but flow off through the atmosphere and into water bodies over time.\nA widespread freeze occurred in September at Antibes, making that part of the El Niño even more of a problem. Scientists say the freezing temperatures were disrupted by the freezing soils around the Golden State, which contributed to the melt of rock and rocks near the melting ice caps. The depletion of these compartments forces groundwater and groundwater in the Northern Hemisphere to continue to accumulate, increasing temperatures.\nIn Colorado’s Shadow Mountain, one of the world’s busiest and driest reservoirs, oxygen levels are extremely low. Communities on their way to the border have lost their drinking water with a recent air pollution crisis.\nThe surface land has lost millions of acres in water vapor, yielding deep-water oil and gas deposits. In the US, more recently, storage tanks on the Pacific coast fed by commercial harbors have been wrecked and have polluted the water supplies. San Bruno, the city of San Francisco, has gone from 250,000 acres of urban solid waste to just a few dozen, considered to be the smallest of the San Francisco Bay Area’s cities.\nThe rapid rise in global temperatures is largely due to El Niño, which is strong but unlikely to affect California’s climate. For California, its most valuable natural resource is the land, which requires basins and other supplies from agriculture. When El Niño flares, the water that cooks up in the mountains can also become a reservoir for reservoirs, providing power to cities, generating energy for factories and air conditioning for local roads and infrastructure.\nThe Earth is turning toward less than a two-degree rise in the average temperature in 20,000 years. This has largely been thanks to El Niño events and is a hot spell that they’re fairly sure to hit us in the summer.\nAs a response to this void, the implications of climate change might be great. Here’s a proposal that could be addressed by 2030.\n']"

That is because the exchanges are actually made up of business lines and areas of the country.\nThe three exchanges are from the Ontario Ministry of Labour, the Toronto-Dominion Bank and the in-province Canada Post. Quebec provides paid sick leave for Ontarians based on population. The Registered E-Wine Employees Limited Partnership, the Registered Motor Vehicle Society of Ontario and the Quebec Office of the Taxation and Finance have paid sick leave programs in place since 1981.\nOnce you become employed, you receive a sick leave allowance of $25 a week in 2014. So if you’re sick and you don’t get paid sick leave during the next year, you can take it off Jan. 1 for 2014 and avoid any penalties the following year.\nIf you’re a family, then it can be more effective to work out with your spouse and dependents so they get plenty of extra time to visit family and help with things such as preparing meals or planning child care.\nIt’s even worth in-state tuition for infants and children so they can be in school.\nWho knows, says Stephen Keen, the president of the Toronto-Dominion Bank. It may be wiser to offer paid sick leave to vacationers, so for that reason, the bank has decided to support the idea.\nLiz Pulver is a reporter for The Canadian Press.

679,Column: The failures of the last bailout should alarm us about the coronavirus bailout,"[""To be sure, the U.S. should admit that the effective remedial efforts made by the 2005 bailout were a bit woefully inadequate. The best available estimates are that the final provisions worked out to only $130 billion, leaving about $60 billion in potential interest. Today's estimate is much lower than the $500 billion Republicans campaigned on in 2008, and it could easily be a lot lower. Congress should do its utmost to reform the whole financial system. There is only one basic metric of a financial system problem: how many people would survive a calamity without another bailout.\nCongress should get on board with this. It should insist on universal funding for every industry — commercial, retail, residential, institutional, institutional, and food — in the hope that it will save the financial system. (That means raising taxes on them — or paying for new regulations.) And there is a way to cover for losses during bankruptcy: for every second a bankruptcy occurs, the government would pay for a second bailout. It should also offer even more assistance to the poor, the wounded, and the recovery victims.\nThe Congress should ask a question — like, why does Wall Street's pay raise the forecasters about growth? How is it fair to expect economic growth and employment to be 20 percent and more if stock prices cannot do the job? Or to expect the profits of another firm to be tenfold — it's not fair.\nCongress should ask: does the bailout make it worse?\nPerhaps, but Congress should get right to the core of all these questions. Congress should simply remember that the first bailout was mostly about eliminating debt for business, mainly. And that private companies didn't get their hands dirty enough to do that. A bank bond, to run as a long-term debt issuer, wasn't used long enough to help commercial mortgage-backed securities. That should have been all that Congress could have done. And Congress should ask whether the result of a prolonged delay was a better outcome than the first bailout.\n""]"
680,Column: Leaving seniors to fend for themselves during pandemic ‘has cost lives’,"['Dear Editor,\nThe guardianship of seniors in the Dominican Republic on behalf of the general public is back in lockstep with the international conferences and forums on pandemic in the Dominican Republic, a goal of which it was at once once. To further stigmatize the vulnerable populations, we encourage the United Nations children and families in the Dominican Republic to volunteer their time to provide early care to vulnerable citizens in the US. Unfortunately, these communities do not have enough social and medical resources to run their day-to-day lives free of fear of transmission of HIV. If called upon, they should not be helped – whether by the media, the UN or these organizations – but students, workers, workers, teachers, patients, workers who have even before been exposed to HIV/AIDS. However, those in our own country, any measure for making the present security and prosperity of the Dominican Republic a reality will add political, financial and humanitarian costs to the society.\nWe should be proud of the pro-people, progressive nature of the Dominican Republic, which has allowed the Dominican Republic’s society to attain a very promising number of socioeconomic movements and participates in global community. However, these are not options for the general public, so instead, they should hold back. In these situations, the president of the Dominican Republic leads a government of “the people” who does not have a pure political machine to administer the personal and social mandate in society. The American presidential elections and the 2018 World Cup are extremely popular events and rather embarrassing events and shouldn’t be handled by the civil government. In this case, the government should attempt to postpone the fall of the current governing authority and give their term another month or two.\nYours faithfully,\nProf. Chifley MacDonald\n']"

But he had few political experience to call his biggest project an attempt to remake the country and change the course of the world.\nHis “Build the Wall” campaign has been met with skepticism and political scrutiny. The president’s summit with Kim Jong Un in Singapore in April has also stirred calls for a free-trade deal between the countries, despite Trump’s suggestion that only good trade could allow this be the meeting of the year.\nTrump may have only admitted more to the release of the secret “My China” audio by saying he’d like to start dealing with China in a chat that he wants to hear from them.\nBut what surprised observers was how far Trump did push back against the inappropriateness of what he referred to as “fake news” in an early public remark by saying, “Did I make too many mistakes? You would think so. But of course I made too many mistakes.”\nIn the same way, Trump threw his support behind SpaceX CEO Elon Musk for a new Space Launch System rocket, and then struck a compromise with President Bill Clinton that gave him the ability to invest more heavily in the space program — funds he’d always wanted to move away from — in return for no pay off.\nIt seems surprising that Trump made this deal with SpaceX because it appeared to be the inevitable way to make a major shift in economic ties between the United States and its tech-rich Middle Eastern partners.\nHe also might be grateful that Musk, the man who committed to constructing a massive airfield in the country that now hosts nuclear submarines and Trump’s golf club, is excited by the idea of a joint venture with Iran.\nAnd perhaps he’s not running for president.

While you should update your resume just to get the benefits, you’ll have to look back and read through your resumes every few months. If you’re unemployed for any reason, your chance to file for unemployment insurance could look more easily at another employer, which might let you apply.\nIf you still do your job for 12 months after you last registered with the Family and Medical Benefits Administration, file for unemployment. If you were laid off, your benefits would end at the beginning of 2020.\nHave a great resume, but don’t neglect the job search — it’s vital that you go through the process. You might be ready to apply and want to submit your resume every few months, but you’re likely to waste your time, and your employer isn’t interested in hiring you.\nTo file for unemployment, you need to file a three-year application form and apply online to the jobs of your choice. There are a number of ways to submit your resume and receive benefits, but the easiest of the two is to file online.\nTo secure a job, you can fill out an online application form that you can view on your phone, tablet or smartwatch. Check the bios and make sure they are all relevant. The more relevant the bios, the more qualified you are.\nDepending on your job, you may also need to decide whether or not to use the social security numbers (RSNs) that you might need to use to file for unemployment benefits.\nIf you’re considering a Roth IRA, it’s highly unlikely that you’ll be eligible for benefits when you start it later this year. Then, though, if you might run into other expenses beyond the Roth IRA, it’s unlikely you’ll be eligible for benefits when you start the Roth IRA. Your benefits will be spread on a sliding scale.\nYou may also need to consider looking for a disability insurance policy. This is something that’s not always available with a disability insurance policy. It’s much harder to transfer your pay into an IRA without worrying about what other expenses will be affected. Here’s how to give this option a try.\nIt is true that tax is a big factor in how often you file your taxes. You should be able to file your return each April and pay your expenses throughout the year. Once you’ve come to this point, your taxes should help you pay for your benefits. You can also file a Form 4827 that has accurate tax information.\nObviously, this information isn’t always accessible to everyone, but you can still file your return.\nBefore filing your return, determine your income and income jointly and if you plan to get child support.\nA qualified doctor or dentist may qualify you for the tax break that comes with a qualified nursing home lease.\nThe highest risk in filing for unemployment benefits is a potential crime — it could land you in a long list of court battles and public service challenges.

However, that was never the case with anthrax, and no one has ever written off the gene or clue into what they are up to.\nIt turns out that the burden of international media coverage has been taking over and the quacks in the administration of the disease – and this website should be doing everything it can to explain how such a virus can gain global acceptance.\nIn fact, this new knowledge is making many people nervous, all over the world, but the sad fact is that the rich are the easiest to treat.

691,Column: The New Deal has lessons for the coronavirus crisis — but not the ones you think,"[""Editor's note: this article was published on April 1, 2019. It was written by James Kenyon, who joined Pfizer as Global Head of Global Respiratory Programmes and Research.\nYou may have missed last week's New Deal legislation, which scrapped the complete overhaul of the Fair Trade Act over concerns that over-regulating labor would be more harmful than what we're seeing now.\nThe prior co-op had proposed a 2% wage index against which consumer protections would be curtailed. But the exchanges that currently carry out that project failed to act as an effective benchmark for all sectors, including businesses that would face higher costs for new products than those that do. How do businesses get there? By preventing hundreds of thousands of products from being sold on the same exchanges that can't challenge them and which will be subjected to several years of market failures with diminishing returns.\nTo build a market, New Deal leaders succeeded in trying to devise a wide range of alternative remedies to raise productivity without really improving efficiency or bargaining power for big companies. These can include “privatization of labour” to bring more competitive advantages to workers — let’s call them labor- and supplier-friendly exchanges. But transparency is really what you’ll want to work with most New Deal members: Sufficiently vigilant consumers. Once these trade agreements become law, they will only be useful in sharp contrast to the reckless assumptions that brought New Dealers to power in the first place.\nSufficiently vigilant consumer rights across a wide range of sectors mean that America is only acting so far at the far right of that right that it's willing to listen to what the average consumer is saying. The views of progressive, progressive-minded consumers look dangerous in the Postmodernized world without the notion of fairness in the 21st century.\nMaking new products and services cheaper and more comparable to competitors will lead to a continued safety record. America should never have embarked on this sort of process. Paying for new products and services should continue to be based on standards of safety and transparency. But we should also respect other types of higher-standard agribusinesses — such as institutions that handle derivatives and others who operate under unclear standards of fair regulation. There is no reason we shouldn't let these kinds of enterprises thrive here at home, particularly in a world where technology and regulation, the arts and sciences and artificial intelligence will continue to disrupt economic life for many, many years to come.\nInnovative trade agreements that bar big corporations from engaging in protectionist trade wars that aim to force industries to raise productivity across a wide range of sectors will not bring good consumer protections, no matter how hard politicians and industry try to pretend otherwise. Contracts are worth more today, but it can be slow and difficult to get them to pass muster in the postmodernized world. The New Deal should allow for these kinds of deals to go forward and for our allies to work together in the New Deal era.\nNow, what may seem like progress in the postmodernized world is a mere footnote in the decades of progress that enabled the expansion of a diverse array of new markets and companies, which span to the fullest across countless industries and businesses. There is no getting around the fact that a more vibrant market with a competing set of standards that properly addresses consumer interests is not going to happen here. But the ways in which modern rules can apply to the postmodern world of workplace protections and services will continue to be challenged and they will only get worse as more resources and consumers are forced to buy products that don't do their jobs.\nWill we repeat the mistakes of the post-World War II era? Would we even have succeeded if firms were able to deliver lower costs, improve quality, provide goods and services at affordable prices and by bringing those characteristics about, instead of trampling them at the point of maturity? That the post-World War II era was the end of Europe's progress toward lasting peace might well have been exceeded if the post-modern technology world was relatively stable, rather than the inexorable transition that its technology allies have collectively been striving for. The post-New Deal era is at least welcome, if not overdue, for certain of that chance.\nJames Kenyon is the director of products economics at Pfizer.\n""]"
692,California companies jump in to supply ventilators needed in coronavirus fight,"['SAN FRANCISCO — Separately, a California-based company is offering helicopters equipped with ventilators to provide temporary ventilators for sick coronavirus patients who have come into contact with children in veterinary hospitals.\nSALEM, California-based ventilator company Dxephrotic and Westminster Veterinary Emergency Service are among companies that entered the coronavirus fight in February, pairing a team of 40 people to feed up to 1,100 children who suffer from the disease.\n“We’re giving the ventilators non-stop air transport as long as you want to keep them hydrated, and we’re all hypothermic because we have two pH-sensitive skin parts. Each area has the ability to cool off quickly,” said Theresa Paul, PhD, director of pediatric infectious diseases at UCLA-affiliated Neurosurgical Specialty Hospital.\nBrett Cameron, program manager of the Ebola Virus Disease Specialization for the UCLA Veterinary Emergency Center, was part of that team. Another patient with HSA was an infant with malignant brain tumors who contracted the virus.\nTracy Pfaff-Shain, chief operating officer of Avalere Health, the nation’s largest vaccination program for measles, mumps and rubella, agreed the Hepatitis C vaccine was a tricky issue.\n“It’s hard, but don’t get me wrong. It’s complex,” Pfaff-Shain said.\nBut Pfaff-Shain and other officials wanted to know where the line could be drawn on the need for the newly vaccinated patients. She suggested a helicopter based on protocols expected to be finalized later this year, and the sound bite was a radio broadcast on their cell phones.\n“Are they sure they want their children to be vaccinated,” Pfaff-Shain said.\nThe hospital’s training mission began a year ago, and Pfaff-Shain and other staff contracted the virus to find one in the forest where the infant recovered and was housed. Their job was to vaccinate children, but survival plans typically depended on whether they pass the vaccine or die.\nDuring the production of production, the staff was briefed on protocols used in the coronavirus, with callers telling how they wish to handle the announcement, depending on the severity of the illness. The result was an outcry from animal health advocates, most notably the name “Vaccineageddon.”\nBefore the team arrived, officials were encouraged to provide parents with vaccines as an inexpensive option. While many of the families took a tally to cut their medical bills.\nThe team eventually rented a room at the Yolo County Farm School in Forks for the patient who survived in quarantine and was healthy enough to be vaccinated. It then served as an incubator, feeding the children who took the vaccine.\n“We’re focused on families who have to move, that’s the other issue,” said Paul, another immunologist. “Because we have to put a brief stop to them, we need to set aside funding for future use.”\nPfaff-Shain was in the crowd but on duty due to the germs. She was relieved because a 23-year-old has to undergo a full-time abortion before the fetus can be delivered in the womb, but executives have been working for a couple of months to gain a full-time maternal status to accommodate full-time employees, and the office had three staff members, one from each of the family-relations center.\nPatients will be able to get them back in four to seven days after giving birth, and they could remain in the unit for six months.\n“Vaccineageddon” has been debated online, and when it begins it “will surely be divisive,” said Dr. Kaibal Davar, chief medical officer at the American Geriatrics Society. He estimates that 25% of births will result in heart surgery and strokes.\n“We’re in the middle of a campaign to combat the underlying cause of the disease. The question before us is, is the immunity to the virus enough to prevent the long-term complications and death of the sick and infected adults? Or is this so messy that I can’t see it going away?” Davar said.\nBut rescue is on the top of that list.\n“This is so how do we achieve the diagnostic and treatment needed, but the bills they’re going to have to cover,” Davar said.\n']"
693,Now is a good time to get a financial tuneup. Here’s how,"['If you’re going to save money, it’s time to have the financial plan in place.\n“When people begin saving for their retirement, they start having a conversation with a financial advisor about what the biggest hurdle to raising a family is,” says Kristin Viljoen, chief asset and equity officer of Nedeljorp, a financial advisory firm.\nThere is no mystery why people tend to focus more on investment management strategies. For many, though, it’s just a matter of compounding the withdrawal problem.\nBanks and credit unions are the way to go. “People close to them tell me that they feel their balance sheets are a good one, but they realize that they need to be positive and positive and positive themselves,” Viljoen says.\nSome think funds within their institution, such as CDs, bonds and mutual funds, are a better use of funds than others. So when it comes to saving for retirement, “a fund with a zero percent expense ratio may be a better choice than an index fund with a zero percent expense ratio,” she says.\nHow to treat the money you get from various investments\nIt’s not uncommon for people to use multiple managers in a fund, but the main distinction these new funds have is that some can do all the investment, while others only give individual investors the option of making a percentage of their money in them. Because of their value, they are typically liquid — you can earn any of these gains and still let yourself run your own money out of the fund.\nWhen it comes to balanced funds, in fact, you can limit the total amount you have to invest, and invest more slowly than a balanced portfolio, depending on the fund’s mix. The downside: If you do take the money out at the first sign of a market downturn, you will lose it in the near term.\nBut in most cases, with your money left over, you don’t have to spend any more to reinvest it. If you have money in a relatively liquid fund, you should give it back to the owners, so they can probably take care of it.\nWhen you have too much money, plan to put it back into more actively managed strategies, such as mutual funds, which are geared toward generating smaller total returns over time. In theory, those strategies include the products offered by emerging markets, such as high-yield bonds and preferred stocks.\nIs it time to roll back?\nThe big risk to money management from young investors is that they can get stuck with too much of it. Many are considering roll-back strategies that focus solely on distributing their money, says Bridget Kultmann, managing director for investments at Henderson Funds in Malaysia.\n“Most of these strategies get away with no stress because they’re passively managed, but once we’re through the year, it gets heated up,” she says.\nThis is where some people start thinking about rolling money out of one fund to another. When you drop a part of your portfolio into one investment fund, the amount you own will grow a bigger portion (about 20 percent) — but you don’t want to lose it all.\nHow long will it take?\nThat’s the question that comes up: Will it take us all years to roll up all of the money in one asset or index, and it will take us most of that time to own all of the bonds, to retirement?\nMitt and Eric Gold of Mischa & Sachiko, a financial advisory firm, note that there are 60-70 days before you have to roll out a fixed-income investment. This is significant because the less assets in your portfolio, the lower your average daily volatility.\nAt the end of the second quarter, you have 38 days before rolling it out, and that ends at the end of December. The risk associated with a fixed-income strategy is much more difficult to manage than in a balanced portfolio, which can take months to fix. It’s not impossible to make use of money management strategies, but if you don’t make use of them, it can take many years.\n“In the earlier stages of a balanced portfolio, a lot of the problem is having less or less time to adjust, and then more [study] to figure out how to do it better,” says William Mendelsohn, chief executive officer of Banning Floor Investment Company in Toronto.\nStart early\nSince you might be tempted to simply allow your money to go out, think about how much of your portfolio you do have to hold — and the risk of what can happen if you let your money fall out. “If you don’t manage it properly, you end up with more and more money,”']"

695,A happy little miracle in dark times: The plant nursery business is booming,"['Whole plants often make life impossible for small ones and are typically failed by the rest of the farmers.\nFor growers struggling with the ever-changing climate, power cuts, fissures and accidents, that means growing crop after crop until everything is sorted out, meaning big returns.\nSo to profitably maintain these current services, growers first gets themselves insulated in an emergency situation.\nBut as 2017 turned into 2016, and millions of wagers were wiped off of their wheat stalks and half of the country’s exports plummeted, the situation has got worse.\nFor those irrigators, the harvest season (except for weeks that are available) falls on the fourth Tuesday of March. In most cases, this can prove especially tough, with rains from the Carnivore season being scarce and those coming on board much too late to be able to benefit.\nSuch is the situation that Angelamoy Cotton’s crop sits at peak maturity in the Carnivore area, finding it difficult to divide its outputs into 2-weeked grow seasons to protect the profits. The infrastructure at the middle of the industry has collapsed, and many growers are forced to close as early as this morning.\nThese closures are taking with them tremendous amounts of lost revenue for the sector and their farmers, who must also work to make ends meet in the weeks ahead.\nBut when there is help, the only chance one can offer is a regular supplier.\nPupils, who used to pass through Phoenix Midstream in the town, need a steady supply of seeds and fertiliser, which are sold to breweries across the country and almost all of them are owned by farmers, who, in turn, then claim the loans.\nFinding a supplier and a sustainable deal can be a tough task, but they might be able to help get the industry started again.\nHappier days for the Eden Hill seed farm but a decline in prices meant they were shut down in 2018, in order to avoid a potential import ban.\nThese days, the Cascade Seed Farm employs an experienced team of growers who have helped co-ordinate crop to the local stockgrowers.\nJust as important, they also need to help other people — growers and producers, and milling equipment, as well as their own production, communications and marketing expertise.\n']"
696,Column: Coronavirus will hurt us all. But it will be worst for those who have the least,"['In the case of viruses, humans usually have a severe immune system that fights us. Then, like hurricanes, an immune system comes into sharp relief. A hurricane waves up against the sun, causing severe damage to the individual’s body and organs.\nPeople with an immune system that fights in that way may see a lot of damage. People with an immune system that fights the same diseases and cancer, etc. may experience the most severe reactions. This happens with the human form of a broadening immune system. It generally manifests itself as inflammation, adverse effects, changing body temperature, and other inflammatory responses.\nThe CDC reports that there has been a 59 percent increase in the rate of survival for these chronic, dormant viruses. They are known to kill people at an average survival rate of 72 percent. They begin causing miscarriages, abortions, infections, and increased wound infections. They are dangerous when prolonged exposure to them in front of a general crowd makes them easier on the skin.\nAnother CDC report states that although these viruses are not able to leave the skin it won’t affect people. They are capable of causing damage and can cause harm.\nThis criticism has a large impact on the public.\nJudging from the CDC report, we probably would like to eliminate one of the most common diseases found in humans. Flu currently carries the greatest burden of this viral burden. About a third of Americans carry an infection that they cannot clear from their skin or regularly use in their home. However, this virus is not a health concern. It is a chronic and under-treated infection that also costs us money to treat.\nBut if we want to get them out of our bodies and our hearts, the CDC report shows that we should be removed from this epidemic. Most Americans have vaccinated against influenza.\nHow does this work? You get shots every five to 10 days, and they work for the elderly and the people with certain medical conditions. When we first get vaccinated, the parents and children can breathe in the virus, complete with the flu shot. If this were to happen to anyone in the U.S., the doctor at your local pharmacy would feel that we have a superb chance of protecting us. It would be very hard to do that without the immune system from affected adults or children.\nNew drugs will be available to take the effects of the virus. It has already been identified for use in people with heart failure or cancers. It’s using healthy people as well as those with type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and asthma. It’s also being tested for lead in drinking water. It is a situation that would take many years to develop.\nThese new diseases will spread across the face of the globe as there are few people with immune systems.\nThat’s a win for us all. Everyone wins if we fight and get our families back on their feet. And if we lose our homes, then the damage gets severe.\n']"
697,"As California shelters at home from coronavirus, construction of housing goes on","['SAN BERNARDINO — It’s a first. Despite a 20-year slump in auto parts sales, so much of Los Angeles’ auto-related infrastructure is under water.\nInstead of servicing the state’s congested highways, Los Angeles is relying on bigger residential centers in its two largest cities. It will be three times more expensive to build new homes in the Stennis system, which has frozen the ground floor of commercial and residential complexes. It will take that into account when building new condos in the Lower Triangle, where 20 new vehicles are sold each week.\nThe challenges are even more acute in the world’s second-largest city, a country with a population as large as Disneyland and millions of kids.\nThe sheer size of the Los Angeles system can offset some of the cost. A recent analysis by IHS Global Insight found a $120 million price tag for a new primary-homes complex in the Crenshaw section of downtown and $120 million for an 89-unit, 14-unit senior housing complex in the Hacienda Heights section. The other way to cope is to buy more condominiums, including in the city’s aging warehouses that otherwise would need to be rebuilt or expanded.\nAs recently as three years ago, the process for getting the next big contract in the LA housing market had seemed tepid. But when Los Angeles real-estate industry executives greeted a nationwide group of investors at a Builders Conference in Miami, they were all excited and optimistic. The first or second phase of construction at Block Island in downtown Los Angeles would begin in a year or so.\nOver the summer, when the field opened to visitors in early January, the first homes appeared. Then the challenge for build-ups in a city that had long been the dominant oil-dependent U.S. industry hit home.\nExemplified by the Rapid Cities Initiative, an effort started in 1988 to conserve energy by storing more water from the LA reservoir, warehouse and horse park, the Rapid Cities have grown into a coalition that already includes a growing set of other local governments, the California Chamber of Commerce and the trade group Leadership LA.\nThe $30 million plan for the Hacienda Heights building included targeting the revitalization of the empty restaurant district and the construction of an expanded Corona del Mar Cruise facility.\n“Developers were really excited to see how well this worked,” said Rich Teran, founding principal of the Rapid Cities Initiative.\nOf course, not every part of the city is a shiny junkyard.\nThe city’s geothermal energy-based PV system is twice as powerful as conventional wind, and it uses less water than conventional solar panels, Teran said. They also have been used by the city’s landfill site. Some of the federal funding for another building program has caused concern at the idea of using their reserves to offset the value of construction.\nStill, officials expect another round of funding for a new $4 billion seawall in the Sunset Beach section, which is awaiting an environmental impact report. The city has proposed borrowing a second $400 million loan from another western state, California Environmental Quality.\nMany officials are still grappling with the financial feasibility of using the water for hot-water sinks, showerheads and radon testing that will cause rare mercury in residents’ blood.\n(Many said construction of pools in the area was their first consideration for the proposal.)\nMany officials worry about water supplies, but while they have expressed some belief that higher water bills would create alternate uses, the utilities that deliver water from L.A. boil to their customers and manage water like the state utilities of San Bernardino County can’t ignore water supply problems.\nA couple cities in the state that needed water supply about 20 years ago — Venice and San Jacinto — came together to establish the San Jacinto Water District, which is increasingly relying on surface water. A plan for modernizing wastewater treatment at the San Jacinto Valley Recycling Complex in Venice has been discussed, but the need was immediate.\n']"

699,Actress Christina Chang homes in on her new communal space,"['Comedian Christina Chang is renowned for her comedic persona and love of art, having loved the art form for over a decade. Here she shares her thoughts on growing up in a \'robot-factory\' city and her common bond with the brown ones.\nIt started off, but my fascination with anime started before me. It\'s all about imagination and those who know Anime, especially female Anime is such a modern genre, that it would really be hard to describe the ""eggplant"" generation. As comics, anime is more or less about other archetypes -- birds, bees, dinosaurs, giant sea creatures, etc -- as a way to utilize those traits as stand-in archetypes. In the comic worlds, just like comics, the LGBTQ community thrives on unique and unique characters. Many can be found in girl groups and other comics books where the protagonists are very distinct, but anime characters and most of the ones seen in anime are the one and only world mass present. Thanks to Japanese Anime, you will find the same people in all cities nowadays; in fact, LGBTQ and women represent a third of the population. When it comes to popular art, Asians and Hispanics are really making up the majority of fandom. Asian and Latino characters here are getting more attention, having become accepted into Japanese culture.\nWith this in mind, Chang has spent the last decade in working as a makeup artist/cadaver sculptor. She has transformed (often) homeless people in her unit; multi-timing surgeries on mute dudes in her small cube city. A baby next door (she\'s just the kind of kid who finds work by accident) wasn\'t looking for a place to live, but she found one. Chang spent her freshman year in Australia, making statues for government officials, as well as many other places.\nAnd before she graduated, Chang developed a passion for artistically rooted imagery, like Spider-Man\'s ""perfect hero,"" or ""urine,"" which inspired her to create this particular obsession. After college, she worked at the art department at a convention, and saw other Asians constantly approaching her who would do amazing work. She worked with great Asians in her job and even created a painting for a WWII submarine. Chang, like many Asian comics creators, is a fan of graphic design and trends like fashion. She also loves her artwork.\nIn my recent interview with Chang, I spoke a bit about that with Bendis, and she explained why she chose ""She"".\n""I wanted to be Asian at a young age. And she was kind of the opposite of my biological, 10-year-old self, and has never expressed herself very loudly. It was cool to see her go through my jealousy. This is how I felt about her in high school, and now she\'s the star of my generation. And when I finally got her dream job, I also found myself intimidated by that fact. I like art a lot. I love having tools and encouragement to grow and reach a certain height. And finally, I needed to be a kid who excelled under a professional microscope.""\n']"

The Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner was unable to make a determination of cause and effect.\nA final report by the board of the Maryland legislature’s health committee will determine the state’s response to the reported outbreak, officials announced Tuesday.

It\'s not worth shutting them down.""\nState agencies now rely on their 2018-19 biennium to deal with an outbreak of the disease in Maryland.

About half are currently dealing with the matter.\nThe antiviral medication, the Adderall, and the ribonavirus are a link between the Maryland Department of Public Health and the Maryland parasite, which is the only pathogen linked to the outbreak, Gov. Larry Hogan has said he intends to eradicate.\nThe Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner said Monday it would develop an answer from the Department of Public Health in the form of a regional flu assessment that, among other things, would monitor what effects the outbreak could have on the service\'s contract workers, research patients and outpatient services.\nState officials said that the quarantines won\'t bring about temporary fixes, but they could bring more benefit to Maryland\'s 13,000 skilled medical services staff members, who last year were estimated to have received more than $6 million in payments between August and December. The administration has agreed to buy $3.5 million of the money, although the remainder will go toward paid sick leave and health insurance.\n""The Department of Public Health is confident of addressing the structural problems in Coronavirus in Maryland, thanks to the work of important partnerships in partnership with our state and local partners,"" Hogan spokesman Ed Donovan said.\nWorton said the recent developments would cost more money than $500,000 from Maryland state agencies alone.\nHowever, the Maryland Health Department agreed to buy a portion of the money for an emergency assessment, and waived $300,000 off its 2017-2018 biennium budget through June 1.\n']"

Parents may also be more aware that their carrier may spread the virus. And to avoid spreading infections, kids should always wear long sleeves and avoid using any type of breathing apparatus when sneezing or coughing.\n""Let them breathe for at least 10 minutes.

It’s a stake in the back of her mind: “I hope they put my children in school,” said the girl, to which the attendant did not appear to notice and dropped the item onto a lighter. As a devout Christian, Bishop Amy Parent of the Diocese of Bangor remarked, “I am shocked, especially after two weeks of her being exempt from Methodist school because she is poor.” One person corrected the “poor” person: “The kid is doing his own religion [at all times].”\nYou’re pretty much checking your cable before you leave for work.\nIn case you were left out of the loop, here’s the headline of an article by Amy Appleton and Maria Tieri at Atlanta Journal-Constitution:\n“Life exposures in Bangor set off alarm bells. Central Maine hosts massive manufacturing breaks under their feet. But the tourism industries are lagging, dwindling cash flow, and a public health crisis without a cure for it is still going on…. A Department of Labor release yesterday that estimated $60 million in state aid to lower income food groups—including Walmart—has accounted for almost all of the net spending since last November. … The findings, provided to officials by the Department of Labor, reinforce the common problems families face in doing business in Maine. “Just under half of those companies that fail—4 percent—do not offer health insurance or make minimum wage adjustments,” said Kathleen Plunkett, state economic development director. One of those companies was the country’s largest manufacturer of dry clothes for Columbia-based Walmart. Walmart came under fire last year when the company announced that it will start charging customers who don’t have health insurance to bring their own sets of shoelaces to stores. … In 2007, a federal judge stopped the regulation, saying it unfairly singled out those with small backgrounds—and recommended that Congress pass a bill that would create more stringent regulations. That could not happen because lawmakers reauthorized the law. “The Labor Department confirmed during the 2014 audit that failure to certify the state impact effects rules was a serious health risk to employees and the state,” the filing says. Earlier in the year, a Moody’s audit said in its review that many banks could lose up to 20 percent of their deposits because of a spate of thefts of merchandise—more than 300 in 24 states since September—caught by crooks.\nIf your employees are unemployed—or not—that’s fine, thanks.

She first purchased in 2012, but did not have credit.\n“We had a blue ID card, a home deal and a driveway, but I didn’t have credit,” Gilda told TheWrap about the sale. “I still got rid of that so I could buy a home with a lot of money, but I’m not building an apartment.”\nIn March, Gilda filed a lawsuit seeking a judge’s suspension of her Florida real estate license, which bans someone for life from selling private property and restricts who could buy and sell. Her contract, signed after she posted the notes from the books on her computer in July 2012, states that if she can’t sell her home for a minimum of $1.8 million, she must file a “Notice of Bid,” that would ensure her won’t be sold.\nAt the time, Gilda said she didn’t know whether she would be allowed to buy the home without being licensed, and won’t go to court and proceed with her legal action. It’s unknown what that process will be. Gilda is “substantially guaranteed” if she can’t sell the property, a Nashville Police spokeswoman said.\nGilda’s attorney, Thomas Peterson, told TheWrap that he wasn’t familiar with the matter. He said he’d spoken with her when she purchased the Florida property but couldn’t recall what events brought her to Miami.\n“I was there through, not through, anything since last May,” he said.\n']"

711,Column: China rises as Trump cedes leadership in coronavirus crisis,"['Could this be the beginning of a resounding victory for the human race?\nAlready, there has been a moment of reflection in recent weeks at major environmental protests across the globe, and there has been in China the outpouring of humanitarian and social resilience by construction workers.\nA few months ago, Hong Kong activists from the so-called Occupy Wall Street encampment took the streets in the streets for a peaceful demonstration to proclaim “We Are Residents,” and over the next few months those protests grew even more violent. Although that protest ultimately did not spark the riots that followed, the magnitude of the unrest and the central difficulty with setting the record back for the most destructive demonstrations in Hong Kong history have captured the public’s imagination.\nIn Shanghai, on March 31, May 4th, and 3 days later in Beijing, the Chinese Communist Party announced on its Internet that Hu Jintao had declared the end of the “Beijing takeover”. Two days later, on May 5th, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) announced its devastating and immediate end to the “Beijing takeover”. In Beijing, there is a moment of reflection for political leaders of the world who saw the parallels between the planning of the Occupy Wall Street protest and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 in the United States.\nSeventy years ago in 1989, mass protests across the world took place in cities all over the world. By that time, there had been 800 days of candlelight vigils, while demonstrations against corporate greed at large gathered the support of hundreds of thousands of people. The contrast between 1989 and today is striking: the heatwave, the extraordinary warmth, the joys of sunlight and the revolutionary spirit, the widespread support for the causes of mass poverty and human misery.\nYet, the origins of this populist mobilization and the sustained efforts of many leaders around the world attest to another part of that history. The parallels between 1989 and today all emerge because they can connect as quickly as they can to the response of those inspired by that history. (The left-wing protests included more than 2,000 (in 1989) arrested—many of them, ironically, actually college students.)\nYosemite, California, at the center of the decline of mass protests. Unite against big energy companies, personal displacement, and the loss of housing and all that.\nIn both these instances, the triumphant returns of mass protests and of the developing patterns of affective resistance showed that people had a sense of internal and external power. When their violence results, they know that they are losing their power and are mobilizing to work for it, to strengthen a state of economic coherence. When the color of their skin, the behavior of their wives and girlfriends, or their religious beliefs show up in the protests—when they are easily mobilized and to spread their ideas and is broadcast live, this new power is durable. In their own way, since 1989, protesters and their leaders have shown these potential leaders what does and doesn’t mean when faced with adversity. In the alternative, however, they can have tremendous success and self-confidence when confronted with unpredictable long and horrible consequences.\nIt is our understanding that not every victory for the human race is essentially a promise to create a better world. In many places, what we have seen today has been an empty promise and the effects of an incredibly energetic effort. In many countries, dissent is felt but rarely felt; their results are not reflected in popular institutions and politics, but simply summarized as “democracy”.\nIn most of the world, demonstrations are taken out of context and pushed to the side. But there is a complex underlying truth behind the years of discontent: that times were difficult. The World War II and Cold War, especially, were environments in which protests were used to escalate the global tensions. In the developing world, when intense struggles and political upheaval had no end, the willingness to stay alive was only a matter of time—and that was not even counted against the chances of freedom and political self-expression. Many other areas were hopelessly in crisis, as they had never anticipated that their nuclear friends would violently invade their territories. So for many of us, the ultimate return of democracy is rarely seen in the face of uncertainty and hardship.\nWhile the role of protest movement for liberation and self-determination in the 21st century is seemingly inconceivable in just a few centuries, we could easily look back on the inevitable consequence of our failure to produce freedom and political self-determination. We could already see ourselves marching in cities to commemorate this event and in other ways, including the immediate impact on the world of peaceful protest. We could also look forward to even more direct civil disobedience when faced with the threat of absolute authoritarian control and the policy of forced forced expulsion.\n']"
712,Central America fears Trump could deport the coronavirus,"['AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Guatemalan authorities in the Caribbean island of Trinidad and Tobago have told journalists there is little chance President Donald Trump will be able to deport the coronavirus (C.A.V.R), one of the world’s most dangerous types of the disease, and have asked for more detail from U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.\nTillerson said late on Thursday the Trump administration would consult with other countries and countries with more information about the current threat in Latin America as well as the current threat in the Caribbean, some five months after his travel ban was approved.\n“After some time, Tillerson will coordinate with colleagues in the U.S. government to convey our message. We will also work closely with a number of countries in the region to rapidly disseminate the latest information,” a government source in Trinidad told Reuters.\n“In any case, it has become necessary for the U.S. government to speak to all willing countries to share with us the information about this virus,” the source said.\nThe first cases of C.A.V. in the region since the drug was first tested in 1975 have emerged in Central America and the Caribbean.\nCanada has said it expects the virus could be in Canada in about seven weeks.\nC.A.V. spread through people who use drugs or who know people infected in a medical crisis, most likely with C.A.V. infections like HIV and hepatitis C. It is spread through transmitted human infections or from such devices as cyberspace.\nDonatella Rovera, chief of the CDC’s Americas regional director, has warned the virus is resistant to drugs and vaccines and is likely to be detected in the poor country of Lucea about 180 km (120 miles) north of the capital Antigua.\nRovera told reporters late on Thursday, “Possible virus forms and spreads for the very same reasons that the virus can be detected in, and that means they are targeted and sometimes treated.”\nThe U.S. government has been able to confirm that C.A.V. is no longer in the Americas and are awaiting the results of international testing to ensure that the virus does not spread in the region, but urge countries and institutions to change their response plans.\nThe virus was discovered only in north-central Honduras in 2016 and has spread to more than 50 countries around the globe, U.S. officials have said.\n']"

714,News Analysis: The new U.S. hope for replacing the president of Venezuela: Coronavirus,"['Money shot up in Venezuela, with UNICEF calling for President Maduro to be put on trial over allegations that $365 million in allegedly fraudulent transactions may have been misdirected to Nicaraguan opposition candidate Vator y Nacional (Ecimitación Arima). Jorge Mas has made a big gamble in terms of advertising the island nation, but apparently has not met the promise of replacement. With this new money, the country is starting to find its footing.\nThe deal with Venezuela – which has an independent energy authority, national oil company SOMA, on one hand, and its regional bank CBN and Ecopetrol on the other – was for $275 million. Cash has come in again, and with this fund, there are no conflicts of interest, no governmental meddling or impending collapse, and the U.S. will pay a $25 million settlement in lieu of actual damages. The money never comes into the country but is therefore valued to the socialist nation.\nThe exit of Donald Trump, if anything, will have to give way to a more fundamental change in Venezuelan foreign policy. However, the new relationship with the other two countries “has to change quickly.” Trump wants to remove Maduro and rein in the ever-rising inflation, which is startling, horrific, and likely going to spark something similar to war with Iran. Even more important, he is looking into new ways to get out of the region like Russia. Businesspeople who would rather spend their leisure time selling the Venezuelan property are likely to oppose Trump and wanted to pay the price.\nThe new Venezuela pipeline is likely to be put on pause. They would never have been able to find value in a real estate with oil prices of US$60 per barrel. The country was primarily served by the pipelines to China and was further since they are not pipelines that can easily be converted into commercial profits. Maduro could reverse the sanctions, but maintaining sanctions alone won’t solve the cause and the problem will go on for some time.\nSo, even with the new oil revenues, the country is on the verge of being unable to pay Venezuela’s legal bills and investments and the government pays scant attention to business. As long as he has decided to continue with the anti-business sanctions, the economy won’t recover much.\nIn essence, the U.S.’s current weakness in terms of investment is the fault of governments that see themselves as “world class” because of the help they receive from the U.S. going back several decades. There is nothing “world class” about the U.S. causing the rise of social and political unrest and economic chaos. The news media is the only ones that can see the rising trend, causing damage to the socialist system, especially since access to currency has become limited, and the balance of payments balances have been completely out of balance.\nIn this regard, the U.S. has acted as an effective EU arbiter over Venezuelan oil money. It was told by the EU Parliament that it wanted an enhanced role in managing some of this money and was permitted to pay the bill. American Prime Minister David Cameron said that Trump’s actions have proven that: “the sanctions regime needs to be no longer administered to illegal firms.” Other nations having the opportunity to appoint international officials to manage this money put the brakes on this “youthful” and anti-Semitic move.\nAs for the new oil funds to Venezuela, Trump was upset and he tried to urge international leaders to stand against the coup d’état in Honduras that led to the defeat of President Nicolás Maduro. The results were disastrous, the coup was so successful the socialist regime succeeded in taking control of every major node of the Venezuelan economy. Trump may never have lost the election anyway, so this would be a good stepping stone to follow.\nThe only political problem for Trump would be if he wanted to keep himself in the international relationship, especially since the number of fatalities in Syria has not yet come down and recent events of this region could lead to more of the same. It would likely be a black eye for the Trump administration on things like the Iran nuclear deal.\nTo sum up, the U.S. is not doing as good as Europe, but most other nations are. Although Trump has not yet filled these office positions, the new American energy dream will likely be pushed forward as a result. Nevertheless, the new people in power has a responsibility to shape that dream forward. The U.S. has the fiscal control of the Maduro regime and may be able to draw on, or take a more active role in, bringing a genuine US presence to Latin America. However, as the elections take place and change comes to the region, it will be difficult for Trump to keep the presidency in order, and he may never get it']"
715,Joe Biden calls for a national lockdown to contain the coronavirus,"['Vice President Joe Biden called on California to deploy a national summer lockdown to contain coronavirus infections in an interview on Good Morning America today.\n""We urge that people stay indoors, stay home, stay home,"" Biden said. ""We call upon everyone in the public to do their part to spread the virulent staphylococcus aureus. The high concentrations in the bloodstream of some coronavirus infections, the microscopic invaders we just identified, may have contributed to the health of some of the young people the malignancy infects.""\nDelivering a very different but equally important message, Biden called on California officials to deploy as many emergency response vehicles, fire trucks and schools as possible to contain the infection before it spreads. ""The responsibility of the fire and police department is to do this very quickly and effectively, and be prepared at every situation,"" he said.\nNoting that President Donald Trump has called for Trump-specific rhetoric from national emergency managers around the country, Biden acknowledged that the CDC issued a statement saying the coronavirus poses ""a significant public health threat."" But he pointed out that there were more than 60 coronavirus cases in a 24-hour period from 2009 to 2017, a time frame that is important because the virus spreads rapidly.\nBiden\'s words, however, were immediate and forceful. In his speech, Biden praised the joint efforts of California, the CDC and local health agencies. ""Tonight, California will honor our shared responsibility to protect its people and provide them with a single resource to block them from spreading infectious disease,"" Biden said.\nThere are seven coronavirus infections that have been reported in California and the others are spread by breathing and can cause serious burns and oral infections. According to Dr. Margaret Chan, a CDC epidemiologist who heads the California Public Health Care Agency, coronavirus infection is one of the most common viruses and much more serious than the other strains and can be spread by oral and PCE. There are about 3,800 confirmed cases of the virus and 80 percent of those infected die, and every year the number of deaths increases.\nThe California State University professor of infectious diseases, Associate Professor of Public Health and Director of the Santa Barbara Regional Mosquito and Vector Control Center, warned in a statement earlier this week that the California swine flu vaccine is in poor health and it is quickly spreading.\nIn response to initial report that the vaccine was not performing well, Santa Barbara County Health Director and Head of the CDC Dr. Kelley Mary Bernal said on CNN\'s State of the Union last Thursday that the combination vaccine seems to work fairly well in the patient pool.\n""In other words, why wait until the vaccine comes in on the 30th to worry about a potentially fatal complication?"" Bernal said.\nIn some ways, the Malignancy outbreak has been dubbed the biggest coronavirus epidemic in U.S. history. Now that the virus appears to be back in control, officials are working on plans to end the ongoing virus\' deadly infections -- which are suspected to have originated in animals or humans -- and find a way to prevent future outbreaks.\nBiden offered his support for those steps, like a statewide vaccine for everyone in his state.\n""You know what this is not,"" Biden said. ""It\'s not a vaccine. ... But maybe now it\'s time. That\'s all I can say.""\n']"
716,"Despite widespread shortages, Trump hasn’t come up with a plan to get medical supplies where needed","[""On Monday the news for the United States was distributed to a Twitter user, asking the president to put the “cost of every single holiday meal up to $10.” But Trump’s healthcare plan isn’t a perfect document.\nThe administration released its blueprint for how the government will be reimbursed for the costs of daily in-home care for up to 10 million Americans — a figure that falls far short of the 20 million Americans the White House says is required.\nThe White House and the press have never been close to identifying the sort of cost estimates that produce the lofty goals, though many press outlets were quick to note that the plan is based on figures from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Those numbers often include both the government and private companies that do state assessments of the costs.\nFor example, the administration plans to calculate the total cost of each day in-home care for almost 4 million seniors by figuring out how they would be reimbursed for items such as a proper bed and lunch to stretch their budget.\nAnd for those same seniors, the administration would figure out how to pay for their healthcare alone.\nPresident Trump's Health Plan *would make most healthcare affordable for the most vulnerable Americans. pic.twitter.com/XqQr2cBzit — The Economist (@TheEconomist) March 31, 2019\nHealth care costs have soared in recent years as doctors and hospitals are required to provide faster care on outpatient basis, while hospitalization rates — often at the lowest level of recent years — are lower than they’ve been in decades.\nThe administration is calling for companies to submit free reports detailing their costs, and has highlighted figures from the Congressional Budget Office that show the costs the White House wants to include in the plan for seniors.\nIt also set out how it plans to reimburse hospitals and food manufacturers by submitting the cost estimates for the same food products that are included in the final version.\nTrump has long hoped that his administration would bring back the upper-bracket reimbursement formula that has been the default in his healthcare plan.\nIt appears that level of reimbursement has not been reflected in the budget, though.\nSenate Republicans refused to certify on Thursday that Trump’s proposal, released on Monday, contains enough money to cover next year’s cost of the federal medical programs. The Republican plan would extend coverage to an additional 15 million people, which would give conservatives control of the House and Senate.\nDemocrats may be hard pressed to dispute the need for the change. It took Senate Democrats three years to achieve the 51 votes needed to raise the debt ceiling — they do not have a majority in the chamber.\nIn addition to covering the claims of millions of seniors, the cuts called for in the plan would give the Trump administration $2.8 billion for programs that deny people coverage to make up for the ballooning costs of its healthcare plan.\nDemocrats said they would pursue the proposed reductions.\nRepublican Senate leaders Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine said they would work with House Republicans to move the plan forward.\nThe plan is “a perfect blueprint for when needed,” the Senate’s leader, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said Friday.\n""]"
717,"Column: Nikki Haley attacks coronavirus stimulus money for the arts, but culture is sick too","[""President Donald Trump’s investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct against former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley was triggered by questions about whether Trump knew about the suspected entanglement with White House intern LeVar Burton, despite longstanding bipartisan support for both former President Barack Obama and now President Donald Trump. However, Trump is ultimately accused of using his power to steer state spending toward the racist and sexist agenda of Democrats.\nWith those efforts, he announced the Partial-Government Spending Stimulus Plan, which gives millions of dollars to an organization with no revenues. Trump outlined some of the strategy, and the charity Impact from Russia jumped on it.\nThen it came out in defense of donor Kristen Schaumann, which will use her limited state funds to open a boutique movie theater to tout its arts credentials.\nStig Ansberg of the Verge disagreed, and the Denver Post pointed out that Schaumann also shared six pieces of brainpower with Trump and Haley.\nBut Schaumann is gone, and she’s bringing her own money to the theaters in lieu of the multi-million dollar funding for the National Playwrights Association.\nSound like something you might do in America or Canada?\nBut the idea that “winners would contribute to social programs,” a criticism of “politically motivated spending,” may be a fair one.\nCoincidence? Find out in the next issue of Democracy Journal: One dimension of Trump's plan\nBut what if it weren’t true? Is the damage done yet? And if so, what does social media offer in the “leaks” probe?\nThere’s nothing “leaks” about, for example, all the benefits of gift cards but “guarantees” that out-of-state corporations and institutions can provide discretionary business services with people’s dollars.\n“We here at KU School of Law think this is a strong, bipartisan group that would benefit from interventionist programs for the arts and culture,” said Branford Center founding partner Deb Janine. “That’s what I think we should do more than what we should.”\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) gave the first little dance — albeit a clean one — to those businesses and organizations.\nIn addition to backing big-name charities, the senators backed Tennessee-based MSP International, a nonprofit that distributes state-funded training and development programs for colleges and universities.\nAmong others in attendance were authors and students from the University of Tennessee, the University of Richmond and Paulson University. The three organizations had previously visited Tennessee in support of Mississippi Shakespeare, which was a nonprofit through which funds would be distributed among public colleges and universities.\nMeanwhile, Impact from Russia received $250,000 for the projects, including VIP tickets and engaging with a crowd of vetted young people.\nIt can be curious that Reps. Chaka Fattah (D-Pa.) and Mary Jo White (D-Mich.) offered discounted membership opportunities at the event, as did Chicago philanthropist Lauren Dean, who sold her home in Washington to influence the president.\nPerhaps it’s time for House Republicans to reclaim that gold medal they stole when, with respect to sexual misconduct, they were caught sharing government funds.\nBut that wasn’t the case in 2010, when the women who spoke up against sexual abuse by government officials were similarly publicly embarrassed.\nIn a Wall Street Journal op-ed, the women, Shuko Liu, Susan L. Felder, Mimi Soto, Cindy Aiken, Lisa Tobin, Jia Zhangke, Debbie McCarty, Ed Finklaff and David Vito all said they “retrieved” state spending from their donations.\nNeither party had to deal with allegations before, or after, using theirs to go after politicians. Instead, it was Congress, not the White House, that created the funds.\nAnd that’s the way it goes now.\nWith all those charges being placed on the record, for those seeking to make a claim that it’s not true, all of those conversations need to take place now, rather than in a yearlong search to find if the past, which can be reconstructed, has real bearing on future allegations.\nAs Emerson Collective Director Mary Ellen Foster observes: “Thank goodness they didn’t use the most generous infusion of funding that can be found to undo the destruction of many an adversary, including incoming President-elect Donald Trump, who is extremely hostile to innovation and entrepreneurship.”\nUncowed, we are.\nSen.

719,"American consumers, once bulwark of the economy, are rapidly losing confidence","['WASHINGTON — U.S. consumers are now more confident than ever before about where the economy is headed. U.S. corporations that can do business in China may be able to beat that in a few years.\nBut the unemployment rate is 14.6 per cent compared with the high of 25 per cent reached in 1991, and 14.5 per cent for people of working age. After years of strong growth, Americans have become impatient and appear to want less access to credit and higher costs for everything from transportation to housing to health care.\n“They’re dying for jobs. They don’t want them,” said Carolyn Kinsman, policy director at the Center for American Progress. “What they need is more access to credit, and better job training and a credit check every two weeks.”\nWhile corporations are still the major force behind the economy, the rise of the fast-growing Chinese economy has spurred much more industrialization and super-efficient production. The United States led in manufacturing and the world had the fastest auto industry per capita in developed countries in the last five years.\nBut the United States has not done enough to counter China’s trade, commercial and military policies — tariffs and subsidies — that make China look twice like a foreign foe. The United States has attempted to root out China’s trade deficit and shield it from new and increasingly sophisticated competitors. The United States has held back in the past, but is getting bolder by bolstering its position, Kinsman said.\nIn October, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said China would contribute to the United States’ national security concerns and boost its exports so they can compete with other nations. But at the time of President Donald Trump’s election, Mnuchin admitted the trade deficit in the U.S. was about $800 billion.\nThat concern has largely dissipated, said Kelly Smyth, director of Labor Employment Research at the independent Labor Department. The joblessness rate for those in the lowest-skilled or middle-class occupations remains roughly the same, even in the most competitive and attractive industries. “There’s no reason for companies to be reluctant to invest in China if the status quo is the minimum wage in the United States,” she said.\nAmericans have a working-class friendliness to the United States — they have more access to railroads, roads and electricity than many other nations.\nNowhere has the prosperity and prosperity of America rebounded even better than in the United States itself. Exports of products from Canada, Japan and the European Union have had a negative impact on the United States’ economic ranking. Despite a liberal trade policy, Americans are adding new products to the marketplace more often than any other country. There’s a massive workforce deficit that is harder to overcome.\nThat pushes up the cost of many things Americans buy, said James Chambers, chief economist at the National Federation of Independent Business. The choices consumers make when buying goods, materials and services are often too hard to pick.\nKinsman sees all types of products becoming more affordable. “Better choice is the next best thing,” she said. “It’s not complicated, but it really is.”\n']"
720,Trump signs $2-trillion coronavirus stimulus package and orders production of ventilators,"['WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. President Donald Trump signed the first of a series of $2 trillion, 19-month, massive budget deals Friday that pledged billions of dollars in federal spending, many of it related to oceanfront infrastructure projects.\nRep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) is expected to sign the package this weekend after the House on Friday approved the government\'s efforts to revive the embattled Department of Health and Human Services, which is in urgent need of a infusion of Medicaid money and to begin turning over more meaty problems to federal regulators to be taken care of.\nTrump called the $2 trillion stimulus bill his administration has promised and set an ambitious goal for the national budget at about $1 trillion over a three-year period. The budget overall from Trump\'s first two years in office is more than $2 trillion in program-related spending that Democrats won just as quickly as they won in the early 2000s to help restore the economy.\nUnfavorable business climate could be the catalyst. Trump\'s term as president, however, was not defined, and his administration\'s top law-enforcement officials have scrambled to put it at the center of the package.\nAmong the GOP lawmakers consulted for the plan is Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. One fact that surfaced in the bill\'s unveiling was that it contains a $1 billion contribution from the federal government to developing more than 100 air conditioners, generating $13 billion annually.\n""This is really shaping up to be an unprecedented package of investments in infrastructure to prepare for a future that we\'re going to have,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said at the ceremony, which was attended by top Trump allies.\nBut for the vast majority of taxpayers, Trump\'s $2 trillion package was only the opening volley in an ongoing confrontation over funding for unfinished projects in federal safety measures and the U.S. tax code. Key, but highly-anticipated, projects include increased federal spending on fish farms and relief for corn growers, among others.\nThe administration is pressing Congress to approve a portion of the plan to help reverse a decline in the economy and reverse a moratorium on much-needed permits for offshore drilling. The White House in March asked Congress to approve a short-term, long-term tax break for offshore drilling aimed at enticing prospective offshore oil and gas projects. Trump so far has refused to produce the annual tax cuts.\n']"
721,‘America’s governors’: Andrew Cuomo and Gavin Newsom take the lead on coronavirus,"['Political Super Bowl LIII. AT THE WASHINGTON POST/CALABASASANS USA DEMOCRATS, COURTESY\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. – From Rod Laver Arena in Chicago to the Orlando casino in Orlando, Florida, U.S. Democrats have gone over the top when it comes to anti-viral drug action.\nCuomo and Newsom both made a strong case with their support for domestic overdose prevention before their respective “yes” votes in the United States Senate on Monday. Cuomo supported legalization of experimental blood thinners and Newsom opposed a House of Representatives bill that tried to legalize up to 64 HIV-positive people a year for treatment and prevention.\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers asked Newsom if he supports regulating premeditated and generic drug overdoses, something lawmakers have said they oppose.\nWith Democratic leadership concerned about the growing stigma associated with teen drug use, Democrats like Sens. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) and Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) signaled they support Cuomo’s inclusion on the bill.\nUltimately, the senator’s endorsement was the result of a public battle that began before the bill had gained traction. The White House released a statement on Thursday saying that Kim Shin Jr., the man responsible for providing the powder, was killed in the line of duty during a federal officer shooting.\nNewsom said he supports two policies similar to the FDA-approved class action lawsuits against Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.\n“There is a debate being held about the impact of same-sex relationships in America, and here in Florida — thanks to the courts and our right to know what people’s families are smoking and where they are legally exposed to nonstop — we must ensure that the 30 days of so-called routine early intervention are not just a short one that leaves kids an unpleasant and life-affirming experience, but an alternative that provides families with the right to know what they are smoking and where they are legally exposed to nonstop,” Cuomo said.\nNewsom added: “I would encourage the Senate to pass this,” while making his stand an important component of economic momentum. “I would encourage the House to pass this because it is a matter of life and death for the American people. This is how I see my State of the Union address.”\nAt a news conference with Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito, Cuomo also made his stance an issue of the type that defines his office.\n“Let me explain what I do with my health care in the budget and in terms of what I do with my work on behalf of my employees and my public service employees,” he said. “First of all, they understand that we want to strike effective policies and solutions that are fair and equitable to all. … There is no doubt that I am a co-author of legislation that is designed to get good results.”\nWith the bill now moving through the California Legislature, Polito plans to hold another news conference.\n“It is important that we understand the real meaning of that question: ‘What does it mean to me to be working for, according to my values and for my work?’ It is important that our leadership be connected with this issue to shape a brighter future, not just for ourselves but for other people too,” she said.\n“This is a stand between the President and his executive branch and their central role in controlling our own health care system. Because if the nation cannot address that responsibility with an effective policy that has the benefits and benefit of an effective prescription drug program that has the best doctors and cures available to those fighting this epidemic, then we cannot afford to continue to have our health care delivery system radically cut off from the emerging needs of an increasingly diverse country.\n“Therefore, as a United States senator and as a state legislator, I come from a political tradition of standing up for the American people. Whether it is red-leaning and centrist Republicans or Democratic centrists – those with more power than any one candidate – our work will be based on that commitment. This is my hope and belief that the Senate will reach its senses and include and pass a bill that is now moving toward the American people.”\n(© 2018 The Associated Press, Inc.)\n']"

723,Has Joe Biden wrapped up the Democratic presidential contest? Will the November election be canceled?,"['Share\nFollowing its first-ever television debate, a highly anticipated second half of the campaign is being held up and briefly cancelled by the Republican National Committee (RNC) and other parties. Media outlets and pundits have been speculating if and when this might happen and when it would be cancelled. But exactly how many elections will be scrapped? Can Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump (or his running mate, Tim Kaine, if things work out) ever leave his camps in good condition and resume his position of support?\nSeveral key experts think so. GOP Congressman Nathan Deal, chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC), John Fleming, a former presidential campaign official (2004-08), and former Democratic National Convention chair Tom Perez, head of the party, have all penned a commentary piece urging President Donald Trump to abandon his “lamenting hatred for Israel.” The backlash has been swift, sending a segment of Trump supporters who want to see the Rhodes scholarship cut off.\nThe Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) – which was under Trump’s mother’s administration — has already begun to create a security plan aimed at combating terrorism, Project Arrow has stated. The plan, which would leave terrorism behind, has already received overwhelmingly positive reviews. But it’s not just Trump supporters who have pointed out that Trump has openly criticised Israel. Addressing millions of Americans, Senator Marco Rubio said he’s trying to “commit to bringing Muslims into this nation.”\n“The truth of the matter is there are Muslim citizens in this country,” Rubio added. “And you are going to see a lot of them say, ‘Trump. This is what’s going to happen,’”\nOne of the most prominent opponents of this proposed government shutdown is Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii). Gabbard recently met with President Trump and expressed outrage at the decision to hold the government’s entire finances hostage. The shutdown is aimed at keeping the government open to increase enrollment in Medicaid for low-income Americans, while further giving the government less funding.\n“This Trump shutdown is not a conservative solution. It’s a shutdown that is designed to take on these other smaller and less intrusive policies that, we may never see because this action is just too ridiculous,” Gabbard told CBS News earlier this year.\nThose views have garnered widespread enthusiasm in the media. If this year’s elections are cancelled, it will be called “Morning Joe,” a religious-themed primetime weekday show hosted by Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, respectively. CNN announced in mid-February that it will not take part in the late-night talk show as part of its political coverage this fall.\nThe decision to do away with the October televised debate is a positive step and should be applauded. But other prominent Republicans who have joined the Trump campaign in massying their support toward Trump should also look at the timing. Most likely, it will take a little time before Trump’s supporters have taken their grievances to the floor of the US Senate. But he will undoubtedly remain a staple in the Democratic debate this November.\n']"

With only one piece of legislation included in the “floor-to-floor” rider, a procedural vote will take place later this spring on whether or not to undertake additional outreach.\nFollowing the floor presentation, the Committee would then be forced to vote on whether to move forward with a package the already-assembled legislation. If there is not enough support from the Republican minority, then the measure would be sent to the House floor for a vote as a piece of legislation until the second and third phases of legislation are available.\nThe committee would still have to approve the package by the end of June for passage through the entire House or Senate. If the bill moves up the House floor for a vote on the second and third phases of legislation, the bill would be sent to the House of Representatives.\nUpon accepting the floor presentation, Speaker Pelosi and Mr. Obama both voiced their dissatisfaction with the floor plan. However, the Senate version includes increased pressure on House and Senate counterparts from state officials to provide additional information on the fragile and elusive oil and gas patch. This would significantly expand the scope of federal oversight, however.\nThat being said, the House proposal does provide for an eight-year funding extension through 2031. It would be followed by a two-year extension for a minimum of three years. Additionally, the legislation would give lawmakers a general fiscal road map on the government funding needs of the agency while covering up to a couple of years of smaller emergency fund increases. Finally, the bill would include additional appropriations for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for the 2016-2018 fiscal year. Currently, the OMB manages all of the agency’s operations.\nOnce the floor debate in Congress is completed, the proper legislative program to reform our oil and gas industries will be passed, ensuring a more comprehensive and efficient programs for ending our dependence on imported oil. Here’s our special thanks to the Committee’s proposed program, having reaffirmed earlier this week that we will reach this point with legislation, so please be patient, and take this opportunity to watch it as it passes through the House and Senate.\n']"

Fourteen of those patients were in state hospitals.\n“We lost a lot of heart and we missed a lot of our usual routines,” said Ryan Pasko, chief of patient services at Mercy Health Care System in Bellflower.\nHe and other hospital officials said they were racing to find the drugs they needed to maintain all facilities except to provide medically necessary care until the mid-year end.\nOfficials said they needed a 3-month supply of medications to help them fight the spread of the virus.\nScores of people are also being vaccinated against measles, who can spread by coughing or sneezing. Polio and polio are very contagious and hit younger people and elderly adults.\nThe country’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which issued a state advisory urging people not to panic over flu and measles, had warned nearly a quarter of California’s 1.2 million people to get vaccinated.\nResponsible for making the most of a low flu season, family members of each child and elderly parent reported bleeding from their lungs and the infection spreading to family members and loved ones, according to the CDC. At least 51 people have died nationwide from coughing, sneezing or having medical complications from flu-like illnesses.\nBy comparison, there have been 150 flu deaths and 559 illnesses from coughing and sneezing in California this year, according to the California Department of Public Health.\nSurveys of California residents have been showing no signs of the virus — although three counties in the Golden State reported cases of the virus spreading Monday.\n“We’re not interested in trying to just bring this epidemic under control,” said Ed Mandel, spokesman for Californians for a Vaccine, a group that supports the federal government efforts to tighten supply of vaccine for all strains of flu.\nIn Oregon, Jodi Patcil, a 57-year-old retired hardware store owner, said a lack of doctors prepared for the outbreak swamped her office at the University of Oregon. “We wanted to contact other families with students and our baby farmers,” she said.\nWhile most people returned home Wednesday, three people died in Illinois, two in Pennsylvania and a fourth in Utah. In Wyoming, one person died as a result of complications from an infection and one died from pneumonia, and there were 29 treated hospitalizations, officials there said.\nThe 18 Colorado and Arizona counties will have to investigate whether the virus is spreading too fast or not to begin with, said Dr. Mary Ann McKee, director of the Nebraska Division of Emergency Medicine. The four states will be able to offer precautions in the coming days, McKee said.\n“The epidemic looks very different from what we’ve seen in other states,” she said.\nIn the U.S., deaths rose to 21 in 2016 from 10 in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

727,"You might get $1,200 from the $2-trillion stimulus bill. What will special interests get?","['The $2-trillion stimulus bill is boosting spending, cuts the deficit, and borrowing by billions of dollars – but what will special interests get from that money?\nYou betcha.\nWhen the roll of the budget bill was sent to lawmakers last week by President Donald Trump, the top earners in the corporate sector were all donors to the push: Goldman Sachs, Ford, General Motors, and Tesla. (Ford just raised its stake in TransCanada by an over $16-billion last week.)\nThe corporate groups range from Walmart, the largest auto supplier, to Koch Industries, which engages in oil and gas business, to the District of Columbia, where Koch is a major contributor. Major media figures often aren’t included in the $4-trillion trillion stimulus package, but other big names are.\nThe $10 billion went to U.S. hospitals, an all-time high. The $6 billion went to American Institutes for Health Research, the largest diabetes research institute in the country. The $7 billion went to Amgen, the largest biotech company. And if Trump were to go to Congress, this slice of the $2-trillion will still go to corporations and Wall Street.\nThe biggest donors to the bill for corporations were Caterpillar and Bank of America. Caterpillar has grown its U.S. business by seven times that of GM, 20 times more than Ford, and 6 times more than ExxonMobil. The Wal-Mart and Sears-Bistro Group – their founder and chairman – gave $3 billion to the bill.\nThe Cboe Global Markets in Hong Kong is the biggest shareholder of American Express. In total, more than $2 billion was donated to the bill by business lobbying groups and billionaires in 18 of 27 American businesses.\nThese corporate accounts aren’t included in the rest of the $4.5 trillion bill because they aren’t tied to Trump. Instead, they’re cash donations to the committees – such as the Tax Finance Commission, the House Ways and Means Committee, the House Appropriations Committee, the Senate Finance Committee, the House Environment and Public Works Committee, the Senate Agriculture Committee, and the Senate Appropriations Committee.\nMost major corporations – JPMorgan Chase, United Airlines, Coca-Cola, Hewlett Packard, Boeing, McDonald’s, Heinz, Blackstone, General Electric, Procter & Gamble, Pfizer, Citigroup, Starbucks, and Altria Group – are not part of the bill. But the CEOs of some, like Kimberly-Clark CEO Scott McMillan, have donated money to groups aligned with Trump on the bill.\nGiven the relatively long regulatory clock, there’s little indication that Trump-financed policy will be more popular this year. What does the bill mean?\nTrump has already proposed several policy initiatives for the administration, including, first, an extension of the traditional Medicare payment schedule and “cap and trade” (more on this later). It’s not clear what he’ll call those policies; they could be a lame duck, for instance, or a lottery-like auctioning of the subsidies and taxation associated with each revenue stream that the government collects.\nIn other words, he may not be happy with his health-care proposals. It’s also not clear how he’ll appeal to Wall Street, which can’t deduct $2 trillion in commissions and fees from its tax receipts.\nThe stimulus also increases the federal workforce by 13,000, bringing the number of federal workers to 9.5 million. It also pushes the federal minimum wage up to $12 an hour.\nAll of which sounds pretty good for business – but it also raises deep doubts about some of the other measures in the bill. The Chinese telecommunications companies Huawei and ZTE may have violated international anti-money-laundering rules, as part of a deal led by Trump. And all of those state-owned coal companies – where the dam will never collapse – are moving into coal-fired power plants.\n(A second reason, besides the stimulus, is that they may get higher-than-average corporate tax rates on the 401(k)-based investment in 401(k) plans.)\nAnd, despite promises by Trump to lower federal taxes, the bill merely raises the burden of regulation. If the financial-services sector is already getting money from lower taxes, the promise of reform isn’t going to be taken seriously.\n']"
728,Trump brags about his China travel ban. Health experts say it’s had little effect,"['After weeks of disparaging rhetoric on the “fear of China” and “chaos,” President Donald Trump has publicly said it’s about time he stopped those remarks. But, before the House of Representatives holds a vote on his controversial policy, experts at two federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention research centers are saying there may not be much to point to.\nIn fact, the policies will hardly have any effect on the country’s trade with China for now.\nRead more: President Trump’s China travel ban is bad for business\nDrugs, medical products and India are considered key industries. That industry is eating away at smaller companies, with three major drugmakers being litigated by the anti-doping authorities of India and abroad, according to CERTi.\n“They aren’t being bought off,” said Charles Lister, an infectious disease expert at the CDC and co-director of the Harvard Global Health Initiative. “There’s not much left in the will of these companies, a negative pattern. And they [the anti-doping authorities] would probably be concerned about the price of cutting their prices.”\nAs a result, the anti-doping agencies have asked for new testing, better pollution controls, better pollution controls for developing nations and stronger regulations on drugs that flow into the country, as well as assistance to help the medical companies, Lister said.\nTrump on Thursday announced plans to scrap a 28-day ban for visitors from 12 countries. The travel ban has only been in effect since January, according to his January 2 tweets, prompting the public outcry against his response to the visa clampdown. The rules were caught on video from the same day. Trump accused the UN agency of spying on him and made a joke about what he thought was a pee-pee incident with President Bill Clinton.\n“America cannot continue to allow their own countries to leave the country without warnings, or with the fear of going into harm’s way,” the President said, according to the Associated Press.\nIn his meeting with Chinese leaders and business leaders on Thursday, Trump promised a halt to the visa-restriction and harsh penalties. Trump told Congress he will send the order to Congress for lawmakers to sign.\nBefore the visa-restriction law took effect, the Trump administration said, officials likely would offer waivers to companies that applied to enter. But that would be nothing compared to the new policy.\nHerman Marshall, a healthcare economist at RAND Corp. who also studies the health system, said it could be a sign that the administration isn’t taking action to blunt the impact of the anti-doping ban.\n“If it was actually conducting trials and they found something, I’d be shocked,” Marshall said. “The bad thing is that they were trying to do it politically in a bad way.”\n']"
729,Q&A: How big will your government check be from the coronavirus bailout?,"['The Budget Budget remains a make or break election for hard-left MPs. Are they on the nose when it comes to tax relief for the rich?\nThe government is working towards a Budget, which will be much more transparent as a result of ditching the dasmitis bill in June. Neither the government nor the Opposition has offered their “Call To Save” for the perennial cash crisis.\nWhat is the plan for dasmitis in 2021?\nIt’s likely to have its own set of tax relief options for the summer months. That’s because the couple of June sales in 2018 is on track to be the highest year on record in terms of sales, and both the budget and spending document show the option was a step in the right direction.\nIn most taxes, the one provided depends on the size of the deficit. In 2025, the deficit is projected to be between 2.5 and 3.8%, while in 2030, the gap is expected to be around 5% of GDP.\nWhere is the Budget Budget Financial Card?\nThe proposal for the Budget Card comes in the absence of a parliament budget. To replace the financial card, there will need to be a budget to “hit” the maximum deficit ceiling of £25 billion.\nHow will the Budget Card work, once it is paid in?\nIt is a public debt repayment book consisting of payments in varying amounts. This will be drawn from a mix of earnings to provide the income required to pay those payments. The plan envisages payments coming in the 2017-18 fiscal year as a first step.\nQ: Where does this budget land, please?\nAt the end of the fiscal year, the deficit figure must rise.\nThat brings the total back to the 110% target of 1% in 2017-18. But the lack of actual figures will be offset by savings. Overall, it will affect the deficit and interest payments.\nHow would this impact the growth in spending?\nThe Budget Card will make sure there is no tax dollars spent on the repayment of the extra bills. Income taxes will also be paid in the absence of revenue, as it will be born out of the deficit. There will also be at least some cash in some of the bills, to reduce that spending.\nIs there something to stick with when introducing the Budget Card?\nSure, but it is a good idea. Between 2015 and 2018, the income tax threshold has increased to £57,000 (plus holiday allowance) from £40,000, but that will be down to around £10,000 in the case of changes to budget provisions.\nThe poor performance of the Economic and Social Research Institute on property over the past five years would be a mitigating factor in imposing a deposit on you, and the final figure could be hidden to avoid the financial effect of the card being legally used.\n']"

It makes the launch campaign a bit more difficult to ensure get-well people are able to get access to vaccinations.\nThe California DMV is growing rapidly, and it’s not only doubling its staff.\nDeputy DMV Director Marcella Grillo said she hopes her agency will gradually lessen the increase, which she described as “a war on drugs”.\n“This isn’t about wishing people off,” she said. “This is about making sure the employees understand that their questions are answered, they get access to the vaccine, and their courses are run by certified educators, so they understand what they need to know.”\nGrillo said the DMV can’t pull off a vaccine run out of a convenience store. Instead it has to adapt its website and let those signing up for classes sign up for a vaccine at will, and send in all required materials before they load onto the Uber- and Lyft-truck.\nMedical emergencies have already stopped at the DMV, but the potential impact would have been strong if the desk clerk wouldn’t be there Monday and Tuesday, Grillo said.\n“I am confident that the supervisors will get to the bottom of the problem as quickly as possible,” she said.\n']"

733,Mass layoffs hit the economy. Can the government’s $2-trillion stimulus plan stem the tide?,"['House Republicans unveiled a spending plan late Tuesday that\'s intended to correct an economic deficit lasting more than six years. But even that amount has been nearly seven times larger than the deficit-financed programs included in Congress\' stimulus bill.\nIn contrast, federal and state government savings have doubled in the past seven years.\nMass layoffs have hit the economy. They\'ve disproportionately hit California\'s crumbling infrastructure, where more than 800,000 people lost their jobs last year alone. And the state suffered nearly $3.3 billion in unemployment benefits in March.\nWe expect the economy to move back out of the recession by early next year, said Harley Shaiken, director of federal economic and labor policy at the Institute for Policy Studies, which tracks stimulus and deficit-financed programs.\n""But all it will take is for the Recovery Act, which is largely President Obama\'s proposal for programs that it authorized in 2009, to reach full employment, eventually,"" Shaiken said.\nJust months before Obama\'s inauguration in January 2009, the recession began spurring billions of dollars in annual stimulus spending. That\'s how much people paid to put their homes on the market, where many were in tax-return limbo.\nAlmost 70 percent of federal spending in 2009 accounted for about 90 percent of the budget deficit. The budgeting deficit widened to $827 billion in 2009, an 8 percent increase from the stimulus bill in 2010.\nCompared with the stimulus bill, new programs would spur a $2 trillion, or 9 percent, increase, to the federal budget by 2020 and, by 2020, the economy would need $1.3 trillion in annual growth.\nSome economic programs aren\'t. Automation-driven wage-growth has consistently been badly underserved by the country\'s aging workforce. In much of North America, the average wage is rising at a slow pace of more than 10 percent a year.\nNone of the money allowed by the stimulus plan would be spent on projects that would speed up growth without the need for taxpayers to pay to do so.\nThe budget includes $1.4 trillion, which is the same amount spent on the stimulus plan in 2010. In addition, more than $100 billion dollars has been set aside as a temporary measure.\nOnly a handful of federal programs, such as: Medicare for the elderly and Medicaid, must be open for future years.\nAnd in healthcare, virtually all federal programs account for less than 5 percent of overall spending.\nBut the budget doesn\'t mention any of the programs, which Congress considers a budget corollary to the job programs the stimulus plan included. Among them is Medicare, which provides health care to seniors in their coverage. Congress might open the program to public financing of large buildings, said Karen Chewed-Shat, head of the department of health at the University of Southern California\'s Graduate School of Public Health.\nStabilizing the economy is vital to restoring employment, leading to a healthier economy and better pay. But hiring? Jobs, not spending.\n""Lack of hiring in the U.S. economy has resulted in reduced returns on investment,"" said Mary Daly, director of economic and labor policy at the Guttmacher Institute, a private research and education organization. ""That\'s nothing like the conditions we saw in the Great Recession.""\nStill, the challenges are dramatic. The nation just kept growing and earning, and trillions of dollars are flowing out of the federal budget to pay for them. In the new budget, a total of $1.6 trillion is included in the federal deficit, down from the trillion already laid out in the bill in 2009.\nIt\'s a blow. Some economists, like Tony J. Delmas of Stifel Nicolaus, say the stimulus plan for the economy must move to eliminate the drag on jobs caused by the worsening of the economic environment, which could get worse as the next two recession sets in.\nCongress is expected to close off funds for the stimulus in a forthcoming spending bill but, if it does not cut spending, it could wind up raising borrowing costs for states and businesses.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) had invited Obama to come to his hometown for a meeting and a news conference on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Democrats unveiled their own proposal on Wednesday for the stimulus.\nPresident Barack Obama has pledged $1.2 trillion, which will come from a range of non-military activities, including building public infrastructure, providing housing aid and ending Social Security disability benefits.\nSchultz has been pushing Obama for the stimulus, as has Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. Obama\'s plan includes $1.6 trillion in construction and nearly $900 billion in transportation spending.\nSchultz stressed that the largest package of pieces of stimulus money will go into the General Services Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development,']"

But some people on the other side of the legislation — Democrats and Republicans — say they want to ditch it forever.\nExcise taxes are the only way the free market can work. Insurance is the only consistent way we can pay for everything — education, transportation, health care.\nOne cost-saving program — the Golden Gate Neighborhood Health Care Initiative — would reduce asthma rates by 50 percent in some schools.

(See Andrew Murray’s column here for more on the Cuban migration crisis.)\nThe drug companies that got the lion’s share of the blame for this epidemic aren’t actually telling the truth. They took the lead, not the government, in releasing studies proving that the virus causes West Nile fever, HIV and many other diseases.\nWhy was the decision to hold elections during an Ebola crisis? What the administration waited for before releasing these studies? Why was the media giving up on it after seeing how it affected the presidency? Why didn’t the administration leave it alone in pressing for word on whether the vaccine would prevent birth defects?\nAdvertisement\nThe first problem I want to fix is in the obvious First Amendment as well as “papalyzers.” The administration had just come out against expediting a government-mandated drug benefit that will help the thousands of thousands of Guillain-Barre residents catch the flu every year.\nAdvertisement\nPerhaps when this new virus was launched, the media immediately jumped at its chance to correct its mistakes on Tuesday. Perhaps the reporters who grew up near the outbreak in Dallas and Pittsburgh didn’t see the news until later. They could see what’s been going on in Arkansas and Spain, but right now Florida is dying, and California’s leading up to the national outbreak.\nAs first I write this, on the heels of the first elections following the outbreak, I’m concerned that state lawmakers are bound by procedural rules to withhold information they want from the public about the outbreak.\nIf it weren’t for medical professionals before the “vast majority” of the workers’ studies announced, we’d have all seen how the virus leaves so much of what we love about the country so vulnerable to communication and communication fails.\nThere’s a reason some Californians disapprove of Vaccine For Everything, which attempts to channel the paranoia and paranoia, and is simply a political posturing exercise.\nOn Tuesday, however, the closest thing to an official announcement came in the form of an announcement from health, educational and community programs — all involving vaccination programs funded by governments for the first time — which include a pointed follow-up from the insurance companies, providers and pharmaceutical companies.\n“Many states and cities have released summary studies that demonstrate elevated potential for chikungunya virus.

According to San Jose officials, a representative was informed in late March that the company owned or controlled by Kmart, the previous owners of the plant, could no longer use or make business or private agreements with the company.\nCity Health and Community Services representatives have said that the water company agreed to reimburse the utility’s customers for the treatment costs, but that that arrangement was not carried out in the case of a health-care center. The utility still owns or controls a facility adjacent to the plant.\nThe city council last month denied a request by the water-plant owner to lease the facility to the city, saying that the process “stems from Florida.”\nCalifornians have used the exemption to seek help from the San Jose Public Health Department, which has been working closely with Cal Health.\nDonovan said a grant request for additional power supplies would allow Cal Health to repair certain elements of the plant. Otherwise, if the company could not be located, Cal Health would need to donate those supplies to the city of San Jose.\nOnce the city has repaired some of the plant’s damage, power supplies must be switched from the state’s National Grid Grid to the California Energy Independence Program, which assigns responsibility for operating the plant.\nTo avoid jeopardizing the generosity of some healthcare providers, health insurance companies have had to use a loan from San Jose’s Metropolitan Water District for the utility to pay for the repairs and to cover basic utilities that have to be serviced before the funds can be accessed by Medi-Cal.\n“Stability in the community was a crucial factor in our decision to work in partnership with Cal Health,” City Health spokeswoman Dana Newell said in a statement. “Our company represents that public service in a profitable business.

Overall coronavirus cases this year in the state are steadily coming down, particularly in the cities of San Francisco and Oakland, which are usually the first to know about a case.\nThat includes Seattle, where a family member of a young pregnant woman infected with the virus ended up in the hospital and returned home, the hospital said.\nIn San Francisco, the CDC says in its first report of this outbreak, the case in Langham Springs, Iowa, was suspected in the death of 35-year-old Terry Koeckler, with whom the couple had been traveling.\nKoeckler was a 34-year-old college and high school associate dean, who sent all of his 2013 purchases from the airline he loved the most to his apartment, according to his Facebook page.\nBy Tuesday, the case in Ventura County — in western Ventura County, a rare case -- was confirmed in four individual cases, according to the county hospital.

And he lambasted the HPV vaccine’s manufacturer, Merck, when it met with CEOs of its hospitals to discuss the ban.\nThe company decided not to make the X-ray-positive vaccine yet, but Wall contends that will be an opening for clinicians and researchers to access HPV vaccines.\nTrump policy comes as government funding for vaccines has tumbled to a 17-year low.\nMary O’Connor, a professor of Public Health at Carnegie Mellon University who has written extensively on the issue, said that barring such vaccines will be a huge victory for small-group programs like Planned Parenthood.\nExperts worry that if the ban were simply extended, a high-risk population would face severe medical problems that could overwhelm hospitals. Some experts fear that the ban could have wider-reaching health consequences.\nThat’s because unlike in many other groups, women and young people are not spared.\nTrump said he would allow for routine immunizations with single vaccines.\nAs the government shutdown has grown, nine of the 10 vumbra HPV vaccines have been removed from the national health list.\nThe vaccine ban was first proposed during the Trump administration, but didn’t get a huge push in the Trump administration.\nThe CDC’s FDA advisory panel told Trump earlier this month that it could pass muster with the White House. The six-member panel members said it would meet with members of the Trump administration so they could work out differences.\nFor many families, those so-called “premium vumbra” shots are a novel concept for treating cervical and other infections, says Brian Winston, director of public health at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center.\nOne vaccine vaccine is already in the works, but so far that hasn’t been made available to patients.\nAllison Stapleton-Neugebauer said she enrolled her teenage daughter into an early-onset HPV vaccine when she was 13.

She had never heard of the epidemic.\nA contraceptive pill, Varifluor, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat sexually transmitted infections in 2013 but was never approved for young women. And since the FDA changed the rules in 2013, Varifluor has not been on the Food and Drug Administration’s second-highest priority list.\n“It’s not that rare for people to get some magic pill that keeps them safe, but it’s not too rare,” Stapleton-Neugebauer said.\n']"

Those populations are more likely to be African American, Hispanic, Native American, and Asian.\nThe group reported that in 2016, the focus of the study was “on African Americans in diverse communities of color.” The numbers of whites identifying as women of color in Los Angeles counties, San Diego, and Orange counties have increased in recent years due to heightened scrutiny of the same-sex marriage issue.\nAs a countywide survey led by Gallup found, about 10,000 or so Californians report that they have experienced increased abuse of the private property they own. The percentage of people who say they have been harassed by their landlord, domestic violence victim, or other victims is at its highest point in 35 years, Gallup says. The economic disparities report offered a snapshot of the ""hidden influence"" of ""influential"" fellow Democrats.\nThe analysis was provided by the United States Census Bureau, which released the latest annual report of the Census Bureau’s monthly Household Income, which covers the 2.6 million most of us live in. It covers households that have a gross domestic product (GDP) below $250,000. Gallup, which had originally released the survey data in 2001, had to pass on the initial findings to more accurate research to produce its current findings. The national survey data is included in Gallup’s current report.\n']"
741,Lawmakers have negotiated a $2-trillion coronavirus stimulus package. What happens next?,"['Reuters is a business.\nA plan to fund infrastructure improvements and create 2.2 million new jobs by 2024 was all but agreed to last month by lawmakers in Washington.\nVirtually no proposal was debated or considered by the members of both parties -- President Donald Trump, economists, and business leaders. One potential source of a revenue stream for a revamp is a two-year fiscal impasse in Washington, causing fiscal policy uncertainty in the business world for years.\nThe plan provides $2 billion in money over 10 years to fix crumbling roads, fix schools, pay for clean water, and create 2.2 million new jobs by 2024.\n""It\'s a very real opportunity,"" said Frances Montgomery, spokeswoman for the Lobbying on Government Reform group that\'s promoting the plan.\nAdvocates say the plan, which would become law after several years, is an important test of a country with aging infrastructure and the need to invest in technology and mobility, since billions of dollars are consumed annually for disaster relief.\nThe plan\'s task is similar to one of President Donald Trump\'s administration\'s efforts to gut the 1993 stimulus package, which helped spur thousands of jobs. Trump removed more than $40 billion in stimulus funds during a campaign-political frenzy in 2010 -- replacing it with a nearly $100 billion fiscal stimulus.\n""This money is money that can certainly be spent on things that could potentially help to improve the lives of more people than any other stimulus program or program would,"" said Sam Kerr, a senior fellow at Brookings Institution.\nA nascent coalition of business groups is pushing for the funds, saying they\'re needed to pay for highways, bridges, sewage treatment, and other infrastructure improvements, which could eventually cost about $125 billion over 10 years.\nThe 3.5-trillion-dollars proposal also could benefit people and businesses who depend on money from federal aid to help pay for building materials for roads, students\' college tuition, and the like.\nThe plan\'s funding is expected to go to other states as well, including Illinois, California, Florida, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, New York, Maryland, Delaware, and Vermont. Pennsylvania and Rhode Island have been particularly active in the debate.\nNo decision has been made yet on how the money would be split among the states.\nThe White House said in March that it would work with Congress to reach a joint funding agreement with the states that will go into effect immediately.\nThe plan was scheduled to reach the desk of Trump by the end of March, and is expected to be signed into law before year\'s end. That would represent a tremendous move in lobbying during the marathon Congress session.\n""We\'re going to know more by the end of this Congress,"" Chief of Staff John Kelly said during a conference call with reporters last month.\n']"
742,Trump’s refusal to use wartime powers to direct scarce medical supplies has left states fighting it out,"['WASHINGTON — Trump’s refusal to rely on wartime powers to replace U.S. war funds if the war on terrorism is averted left some states squabbling over how best to handle scarce emergency supplies.\nSome argue that a roughly $1.4 billion bill for opioids and other health supplies would not constitute a breach of national law and therefore charge too high a price tag.\nIn the Senate, Republicans rejected a three-page memo signed by Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., which also stated that fund cuts to administer the war on terror would violate the separation of powers.\nOthers, such as Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is supporting Obama’s policy of using a wartime waiver to expand the authority of Congress to get aid, argue that the war-funding bill should instead be treated as a temporary bill, with a prolonged period of time to sort out its enormous resources.\nStick to your words: Do not confuse horse and cart\nThe chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Ky., bristled at the idea that a proposed use of war funds to extend emergency aid would result in a national credit rating downgrade or lower than usual.\n“Are we spending the right amount? Absolutely,” Rogers said Thursday in response to a question from a conservative critic of the measure, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va.\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, that same day said: “It’s up to Congress to determine what, if any, actions may be necessary to fulfill the responsibility for war.”\nThe review committee recommended immediately ratifying the legislation, and some lawmakers already are pushing ahead with it in the House. And on Tuesday, former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the resolution would not do anything to “create the unnecessary uncertainty” that many experts say could lead to a downgrade to the credit ratings that provide many consumer protections.\nThe president’s office issued a late-night tweet Thursday saying that a national waiver “is both an important and necessary element” to the authorization.\n“A waiver is an effort to resolve a dispute, and the funds used for that effort have not been used,” the statement reads. “In fact, the national emergency fund will continue to benefit the most vulnerable to natural disasters and … this is not the case at all.”\nGov. Jerry Brown also voiced frustration with the thinking that a national emergency declaration would require Senate approval.\n“It is in my personal interest that this process are moved forward with less overwhelming political support than a national emergency,” Brown wrote in a Medium post Wednesday. “Clearly, the Senate has the final say on any legislation. But getting this right is as important to them as they are to me.”\nThe president’s office continued to defend the measure, noting in a May letter that the health funding bill also would set aside “tons of funds that ultimately will feed into billions of emergency funds designated for interstate terrorism and will be used to pay for our national security.”\nThe American Public Health Association, a national association of doctors and nurses, wrote in a statement Friday: “Every medical provider in the country has been reported to have been negatively impacted by this proceeding, while an exemption being sought from the current funding deal for our country’s national emergency fund has been set aside for emergencies.”\n“This seems to be an extraordinarily reckless way to address national emergencies,” said Andrew Grabov, director of Medicare for All.\nPresident Donald Trump signed the funding bill Friday night, and senators approved it Wednesday night in a 91-14 vote.\n']"

And it could get worse.\nWatch the video above to learn more about Coronavirus.\nThe virus, about a 50-per-cent chance of infecting humans in the first half of the year, is in the first human case in this region, where California operates the Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco Bay Bridge.\nWatch: Could this virus be enough to wipe out the state’s $21-billion deficit?\nThe province has spent $38 million since 1996 to spot the disease, California Coastal Commission spokesman Bev Dawkins said. However, it’s been ineffective and doesn’t “maintain a track record of transmission,” she said.\nDawkins said she can’t be certain until the virus’s discovery – revealed earlier this week – that it’s making up the deficit, but the risk is real.\nThe Local Water Atlas, which analyzes wastewater data, estimated there could be 20 cases of Coronavirus per 1,000 square feet of space and 19 per 1,000 square feet of space between now and 2030.\nThat means the cost of contaminating and causing damage will be higher than the cost of treating water so far, both for California and the region, which could be two to three times higher.\n“The science is probably looking at it as being as big as 100 fires,” Dawkins said.\nDozens of water districts have contracted with Canada-based tech start-up Cuenca Waste.\nThose opting to test for the virus, which is licensed by the provincial government, include patients across the Bay Area, public water managers in two large urban areas, as well as social and environmental managers in Santa Clara and Los Gatos.\nSince 2010, the province has linked Coronavirus outbreaks across California.\nThe greatest outbreak in the first half of 2016 lasted about 30 days. In 2015, about 37 cases occurred.\nDoctors and scientists have in recent months warned that the virus could affect humans for years.\nIn its first-hand report, UCSF researchers warned the people who live in areas bordering rivers and ridges in the Northern California mountains have the earliest chance of being infected.\n“There is a risk that these people could pass on it to others who live downstream on the rivers or rivers in East San Francisco Bay,” UCSF post-doctoral researcher Ned Gass, told AFP.\nAt current levels, Coronavirus could infect thousands, the UCSF researchers said.\nShare this: Email\nPrint\nTwitter\nFacebook\nGoogle\nMore\nPinterest\nLike this: Like Loading...\n']"
744,Column: Shoveling money out of airplanes looks good to Republicans,"['Since Chairman Grassley recently endorsed Rep. Gary Palmer’s bid for a Senate seat in South Dakota, many pundits and pollsters have proclaimed Donald Trump’s campaign for the presidency likely to consist entirely of money or resources for political candidates. Moreover, millions of dollars of research, lobbying and advertising dollars will ultimately appear to the political party in 2016, and just about every other nominee, bar Trump, to have to prove otherwise.\nBut even with Trump in short supply, the GOP (along with a handful of other GOP political parties) is eager to spend money on whatever it takes to guarantee its health care policy in 2020 or 2022 — ever since Trump has begun to forcefully use his political mastery to create a “political infrastructure” to build electoral majorities. As proof, let’s consider what happens if Trump win next year (in which case elections already have been decided)?\nKey Republican leaders stand in a much more secure financial position — and potentially even debt. General Motors, who faces end-of-year obligations due in 2021, is bound to pay a large amount of 2019 federal income taxes, according to a Wall Street Journal review of confidential notes presented to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. News of the pickup of the three remaining top Obama aides earlier this week by a private aerospace company official could open the door to converting the loan to cash.\nBut today, even Trump’s defenders appear wary of how such a turncoat could yet achieve more than his budget would have accomplished. Nominees will usually be announced as 2017 nominees. Paul Ryan, who is the other nominee, has said Trump’s attempt to boost his ticket with tax cuts is too little, too late. And for the fiscal compact that will be embraced in 2020, Trump’s plan will presumably favor business with more of his proposed tax cuts and it will encourage more workers to stay in the U.S. Instead of getting rid of existing payroll tax rates and roll back popular healthcare provisions, he will insist on adding a “corporate tax cut” to the country’s already-stressed deficits.\nOf course, this isn’t entirely kosher. The shorthand these coveted slots could indicate is yet another unscripted move by Trump, who’s already peddling his tax plans with little warning or consideration. It would be a reprise of his twice-consecutive approval ratings if he hits the floor on the Democratic side, which would give him ample opportunities to call any one of the most popular tax cuts “privilege.”\nYet Republican tax cuts and the rest of what Trump has proposed for the year may be important constitutional guaranties of the U.S.’s nonfinancial resources. They would allow businesses to sue administrations to recover billions of dollars in interest costs. The basic point is that Congress has a heavy role to play in making sure the deficits and interest costs of the U.S. empire continue to grow, beyond one, but out of control. The special lawmakers who would clearly be entrusted with making those decisions must act now. They have little choices: either they break with current policy, cheat their legislators of legal bonuses, or make the time and effort to lobby hard and risk losing the supposedly “nerve power” necessary to end policyholders’ standing in their party.\nTo make matters worse, the wealthy Republican class may also be loath to work with a president who’s much more credibly committed to the nation’s fiscal interests. The new president may well be a beneficiary of one of our party’s most feared laws — Section 4 of the 2013 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, for example — even if his bill is identical to his promise to get “every federal agency” (the government’s portion of taxes on business’s share of their profits) fully back.\nThe main beneficiaries of the president’s plan may be little Democrats, not Democratic donors and core constituencies. Or they may also include friendly donors and trade partners.\nThe predicament could well be a familiar one for Republicans. No country of the world is a better beacon of stability, prosperity and stability than the U.S. — and its decision to support Trump’s agenda is not just a hint of the inescapable benefits America can provide at any time of the day, as several appear to think.\n— Terry Peters is an editorial writer for The Washington Post.\n']"
745,Joe Biden found his footing — then coronavirus changed everything,"['Sen. Joe Biden, D-Minn., an early early member of the Trump administration, defeated Democratic challenger Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., in this year’s midterm elections Tuesday night.\nThough he remains the standard bearer in a strong Republican field, Biden lost the race to Duckworth during last November’s campaign, a defeat that landed Biden in perhaps the least-honored position of all. Biden’s race wasn’t quite as close, and Duckworth still won, but in a different category. Biden’s loss was widely noted as a blow to the White House in a way, as Democrats found the self-proclaimed king of pink-shirted action positions increasingly unpopular with the public, and Republicans lost the popular vote.\nWith the loss of New Jersey and Rhode Island, political experts framed Tuesday’s contest as part of the growing shift in public opinion about the dominance of Republican opposition to President Donald Trump, which culminated in the highest levels of government in decades: The new Congress over the years has punished Trump politically for Trump’s policies, policies supported by his populist anti-establishment, populist, populist instincts.\nPresident Trump has criticized several of his policies, including his agenda and economic policies designed to better protect the country from “the biggest elephant in the room.”\nThe latest assessment echoes those of many on Capitol Hill, as he tries to better define his presidency and offer more input into shaping his policies. But today, the bulk of Trump’s policy proposals rely on budget cuts and protection of corporations, including a lawsuit based on a Chinese-Trump agreement that may cost the White House $3 billion.\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, a major pro-Trump fundraising arm, pulled $75 million from January through February of this year, hitting the campaign target of $4 million.\nBiden’s defeat gives him some significant space on the Democratic ticket.\nMost Democrats in Congress, including Biden, would have been less inclined to pander to the Republican base, even though Trump “the bully and the hero,” Ken Buck, a pro-Trump campaigner, spent the last six years running for office, alongside what’s known as “the man” of the district.\n“The message was really that Democrats just wanna bankroll that Doug Buck, who led the fight against climate change. The whole district’s turnout was relatively clean,” says Cynthia Kiser, deputy director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “Democrats know the impacts on individual families of climate change, and of Republicans. They know the anxieties that they find in that. Democrats’ life support measure, that they’re going to dominate the economy for a long time. They’re the ruling class and they aren’t going to get it.”\nBiden drew enormous support from the district’s voters long before Buck — driven by the district’s five-term Democratic Gov. Phil Scott, who was re-elected by independents by over four-fifths. Biden spent his earliest years in the state as a congressman from Washington, beginning when he was a Republican; he’s now deputy minority leader of the House, a job he shared with Buck.\nBiden, who was born in Washington, has warmed to a Republican leadership, and was once a prominent endorser of House Speaker Paul Ryan, now the leader of the party’s House Freedom Caucus. But this race is no longer easy.\nIn the Senate, the competitive contest has also divided Republicans. Under the party’s new leadership, having a state-wide representative is easier, but former House Speaker Paul Ryan, endorsed by his former House Freedom Caucus allies, seems likely to run unopposed on the right. Buck, a conservative and an influential pro-Trump campaigner, already lacks the political know-how to win a campaign as a statewide endorser of congressional candidate Carmella Ambrose.\nBuck, Buck’s opponent, has been the political whipping boy and has not had the time and energy to prepare himself for a Senate campaign. And Ryan, the conservative senator who has practiced in districts long reserved for Democrats, is no longer the “set man” for his party’s victory-seeking push for power, though he’s still likely to face a caucus revolt among incumbents.\nIn the House, Buck has leaned more to the left since he entered the race in 2013. He once supported then-House Speaker Paul Ryan’s Medicare for All expansion and introduced a bill to restore access to Obamacare for immigrants in the country illegally.\n“We shouldn’t be defending Joe Biden because he’s lost his footing after a lot of controversy,” says Matt Mackowiak, an associate professor of political science at the University of Maryland']"
746,Sacrifice the old to help the economy? Texas official’s remark prompts backlash,"[""By Julie Gordon • April 1, 2016\nThe head of the Texas Legislature's effort to crack down on marijuana, Rep. Amy Stephens, D-Houston, has a brilliant comment this week about the old symbolism of what she saw as her job as a legislator: the old art of disarming the devil.\nStephens, best known for her days as an investigator for the 2010 deadly school shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., calmly recounted her experience of dealing with a domestic violence incident that might have led to her mom filing for divorce in 2011. The days marked by the “noise bomb” launched by Ben Carson's plan to legalize marijuana, the absurdity of a narrowly regulated market, and the consternation among law enforcement officers over access to pot may have been the highlights of her trip to Texas in 2014.\nShe then pivoted in a hastily arranged Wednesday afternoon press conference to post the incident online, and compared the situation to the old art of disarming the devil. She said as soon as she realized it was her job to call it quits, she hired a PR firm to help her out.\n“I moved into this position because the issues that this country is facing right now – [cough] marijuana – are so challenging for us as legislators that this position has to be handled at a much lower level than I would have done,” Stephens told a crowd gathered for the Capitol press conference. “I know personally what it’s like to feel pretty depressed about the end of my tenure in the House because of this statement I just made.”\nEvery time she has been deployed, Stephens has spoken of how she could not be in a more difficult position and said, “I want to make it obvious that I am very sorry that this past year had to be this difficult.”\nIn her speech Wednesday, she said she hopes to see an effort to remove the use of the drug as a “toxic or dangerous” experience for many Texans.\n“Over the last ten years there’s been an increase in the number of overdoses of people taking narcotics, and I think that's going to be the issue for everybody in America to consider,” she said. “We’re going to see a huge increase in overdose fatalities, and that’s only going to get worse, and that's why it's been so so important for Congress to do this.”\nStephens is the least of the 20 elected Texas politicians to deliver remarks in response to the fertilizer plant explosion last year. And while she defended her ability to crack down on criminals, it was more to say she was using the information she gathered in a town to avoid the problems everyone faces.\n“I could have kept things down, but I had more intel about what might be really going on,” she said. “Because I was being proactive about everything that could be happening. I’m an avid user of social media, and I had more intel than most people who were ever-present on social media, and so I knew better than to worry.”\n""]"

We don't know the cause and we know the mechanisms of the disease,” he said.\nChronic infection continues to generate a massive health emergency in the United States, Bangladesh, China, India, Pakistan, and Uganda.\nThe WHO said last week that 12,828 people died of bone marrow transplant disease and 1,102 people had become infected with varicella (vastatin) in Pakistan, Uganda, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Nepal.\nHealth officials estimate there are “several dozen” cases of total 4,000 individual infections in the United States and more than 1,000 in Pakistan, where three in ten people are reportedly infected.\nMeanwhile, patients could face an average 45 days of fever, vomiting, symptoms of tuberculosis and shock, and at least seven or more cases of skin cancers and nervous and respiratory infections.\nThe diseases have “a few significant deaths, but all of them are caused by the existing attack against the human immune system,” said Dr. Oussama Riazullah, director of Dengue Westlands, a division of WHO’s National Hospitals and Health Emergency Programme.\n“However, the wounds are so deep that some injuries are capable of multiplying even in people that have been treated,” he said.\n“There will be massive public outcry against this epidemic. We are discussing ways to dramatically change this approach.”\nHe said WHO would need to reduce antibiotic use, add more blood tests, more tests and offer preventative antibiotics.\nWHO said the current arrangement with India is “immoral.”\n“India has opted for reduced doses of its own Ebola vaccines which have performed extremely well,” he said.\nDoctors have warned of a “search for a new way” to cope with the disease.\nThe world’s largest international charity, WHO added, is working “multiplely” with states and local communities to ensure the elimination of transmission as well as monitoring and prevention.\nFor now, health officials have no plan for how to address the outbreak, Bryant said.\nHe said WHO is working to meet the needs of donors.

749,"Report may close door on remote voting in House during crisis, but some aren’t giving up","['Jennifer Michel, director of presidential demographics for the Institute for Research on Politics and Public Policy at George Mason University, tells us that she believes there are indications the 114th Congress won’t be able to call on Democratic hand-ballot nominees for Congress during the 2018 midterm elections.\nMichel says the low numbers for last fall’s midterm election in 2016 did not mean there wasn’t more vulnerable seats in Congress. The top 20 seats in the House of Representatives have shrunk from at least 50 percent of their registered voters to around zero. The bottom 20 are often the most vulnerable in the Senate.\n“Clearly the Republicans don’t control much of anything in either chamber in general, but the Democrats only control almost half of the House, so either the Democratic majority will vote against the same Republicans they have a 28 percent majority in a total election, or the Democrats will vote against the same Republicans that are attempting to hold a majority,” she tells us.\nIn her analysis, Michel concludes that voter participation across all of the 435 Congressional Districts over the past half-century has been unusually high. Elections across the nation often close before the fifth midterm, in which control of the House and Senate will be at stake. One typical example is in Delaware, where voter turnout for 2020 appears to be eight-fold lower than the 2016 presidential election.\nAs with any election, it can be hard to gauge turnout from a voter standpoint. With that said, there are signs that 2018 midterm elections could swing decisively for Democrats if Election Day turnout is significantly lower than what’s expected, says Michel.\n“There’s some rare data here, and we’re quite confident that things will turn out to be rosy in 2020,” she says.\nHow to keep up the ground game\nTo prepare for the next electoral vote, Michel and her colleague Kimberly Fredricks have seen that voter turnout is critical to ensure that the next election doesn’t fall behind in 2018.\nFredricks is an expert in voter experience, and she wrote the current report in 2012 in the “We Expect 2020: 23 w/an estimated county turnout rate.” That study showed that when compared to an election against an expected lower turnout, the Democratic Party would send its candidate to 60 percent of the county. This works out to three percent in favor of Clinton and one percent for Trump.\nThe real number of voters in this election is the most likely to be younger, who are more likely to vote, and more likely to be registered with a concealed-carry permit or a PAC. That’s especially true for the Democrats.\n“These are voters who may be less likely to participate in general elections than the lower-turnout, in-district voters,” said Fredricks, noting that this is the first midterm election where local voting locations don’t have the same election conditions that determine a Democratic Senate candidate.\nNow let’s see if there are any different things about 2018 that impact turnout.\n“Democrats wouldn’t win a lot of seats unless they win 100 percent of the counties, and then get in the Senate with 82 percent and a narrow majority. But if I were you, I’d be pretty shocked by how marginal the Democratic Party would be in their chances,” she says.\nAnother factor in competitive races: When a party wants to win, it doesn’t want to lose, either. This year, the party will have another opportunity to do that, one that might appeal to grass-roots conservatives in an effort to get them to the polls.\n“If voters get this far, they will likely say, ‘I’m on the fence because I don’t want to spend the money,’” said Fredricks. “This makes it more important to have a safe, progressive senator — it’s harder for a national party to get a senator off the mat than it is to pick a president.”\n']"

One Health Fund.\nMonday, the Senate approved legislation to make respiratory illnesses, such as TB, a simple part of national living standards.\n“It’s for you,” White said of immunity for health care workers. “It’s good news for the rest of us.”\nShe added that no one really knows what’s going on around her.\n“We’re talking people who are here for long periods of time, people who rely on the public good,” White said. “But this has been documented for long enough.”\n“These are people who face calls for and need to be paid,” White said, “if I were a worker this day.”\nSenator Patty Murray thanked the Senate for lifting the lifesaving bureaucratic hurdle facing tens of thousands of workers who rely on Medicare and Medicaid coverage for their care.\nSenator Frank Lautenberg said it’s important for citizens to understand that their next job as paid sick days or retraining pays good salaries.\n“It’s a precious commodity and it’s a responsibility,” said Lautenberg, who chaired the senate’s health care subcommittee. “This is an issue that is going to affect the wages of millions of Americans.”\nIndeed, this month the Senate will vote on bipartisan legislation that would require no pay for paid sick days or retraining. By 2020 the government will also cover the costs.\nOnce this new legislation becomes law, federal workers on paid sick days will be protected under the Affordable Care Act. Health care paid sick days will be even more generous.\n“The question is: can we as a society maintain our job security by providing good health care and maintain our potential workforce,” said Kirsten Macpherson, president of the National Association of Registered Nurse Directors.\n“Getting these people paid for the day that they don’t get sick is a victory for both the public and for the private sector,” she added.\n“There are hundreds of thousands of American people working in the private sector who lack access to the coverage that is standard in the public sector,” said Macpherson. “By working together we can keep that opportunity alive for every single American.”\nThe legislation would protect the public sector workers in the private sector for decades, while stanching the hemorrhaging of Medicare from tens of thousands of die-hards to today’s insurance companies.\nUnder the White rule, everyone would have to have health insurance before they can get a three-month pay break, if that’s how doctors recommend it.\nAccording to The New York Times, this public interest law won’t stop upstate Blue Cross from repealing a law based on its provision barring insurers from providing workers’ guaranteed paid sick days.\n']"

Ted Strickland, said the changes are necessary to curtail the growth of fast-growing Medicaid, which already has grown at about double the rate of the overall population.\nThe GOP has contended the state will have to expand Medicaid as newly-expanded states face the same problems as their conservative colleagues in Washington. That hope is thwarted by a federal law that let states negotiate with them, and Trump has said rescissions would be harsh.\n— Scott Peterson contributed.\n___\nFollow Vanessa Allen on Twitter at https://twitter.com/vanessallen\n']"
752,Deal reached on $2-trillion coronavirus stimulus bill — largest by far in U.S. history,"['The National Academy of Sciences presented a mammoth deal Friday on a $2.28-trillion plan to modernize and redesign our medical-device industry by purchasing monocrystalline monocrystalline silicone capsules, breaking a 20-year stalemate, a major advance for the pharmaceutical industry.\nOriginally announced as a health, biotech and intellectual property deal, the landmark deal reached by now-defunct advisers brought in more than $1.25 billion in new cash.\nThe new sales deal will allow the U.S. government to guarantee the company the exit rights to its monocrystalline products, worth tens of billions of dollars and pressing pharmaceutical manufacturers to begin replicating those uses in production.\nThe process has gone largely uninterrupted since the deadline in March of this year. It’s likely to be conducted on a post-sale basis, but a deal may be reached in the next few weeks.\nA similar new deal was reached in 2002 when Genentech bought a small 90-year-old monocrystalline polyurethane for $1.7 billion. Genentech had been trying to organize sales of its multibillion-dollar products made in European countries and had abandoned the process.\nSo they got a deal that allowed the FDA to sort out how to market multiple monocrystalline monocrystalline, depending on the condition. The FDA’s ruling was issued after months of litigation between Genentech and other companies involved. Under this deal, Genentech’s monocrystalline monocrystalline capsules and plastics would also have access to other polyurethane-based materials, including polyethylene, polypropylene and PET, to keep their shapes distinct.\nThe problem was that if enough monocrystalline were produced, sales of each product would be hampered.\nIn addition, the government agreed to pay Genentech for 40 percent of the monocrystalline silicon supply necessary to make more polyurethane films to encourage the formation of new revenue streams. That followed similar deals with Biogen Idec and United Therapeutics, two companies involved in the early development of complex crystal crystal and anemia drugs.\nThe deal largely ran aground when Genentech CEO Harold W. Rahner ruled out a sale of the polyurethane products that already had been manufactured in Germany, saying he had no choice. Then he expressed his unqualified support for recombinant monocrystalline silicon that Genentech had been unable to develop.\nBut Genentech negotiated a deal with U.S. regulators that avoided antitrust suits. The deal allowed it to disclose the results of a study that looked at the economics of polyurethane films supplied by hundreds of biotech firms. A draft proposed deal was not publicly released until early Friday.\nWith approval from the Senate, the deal was fast-tracked before it could be put in to the House this week.\n“This was an amazing victory for the American biomedical industry,” said Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.). “With the agreement, Genentech will be left with a fabless industry.”\nIn an unrelated House passage, the Justice Department sent a letter to Congress ordering the conviction and sentencing of 37 former Genentech scientists for their role in the cancer drug melanoma. Other defendants in the case were Gregory Mellete, a drug developer who was convicted in a separate case, and Henry Berlin, a former Genentech VP and Ph.D. candidate who was convicted of mislabeling false data used in a clinical trial of its drug.\nIn Congress, Morris Otters, former president of the American Society of Pharmacists, told CBSNews.com that the findings of an e-mail-based study pushed Genentech’s path.\n“This was the first step in the action,” Otters said. “And we anticipate that the application to the FDA will advance once they decide to conduct clinical trials. It could be a year.\n“The Department of Justice has provided the parties with a list of cases that should require an immediate review,” Otters said. “The government has put in a strong case, and now the big question that should be answered, or that will be answered, is with respect to all of these companies.”\n']"

They either have cleared the border with Mexico, brought into the country, or moved into the United States on their own.\nMost migrant youth from Central America cross illegally, but current flow is broader than it was in the '80s and has grown to over one million, about 2 percent of the total.\nThe anti-immigrant effort will continue under the new law, which President Trump signed on Feb. 24. It is designed to combat the growing human smuggling, which Obama-era legislation prohibited and ordered police to use legal migrants to apprehend migrant smugglers and associates.\nExperts say migrants often face isolation at the border because at the beginning of the year Americans deported more than 1 million migrants, prompting officials to turn to more effective border strategies to try to entice people to move to the United States.\nBut immigration advocates see the long-term consequences of deepening immigrant connections to the U.S. border as reversing immigrant policy in places where men and women by choice bring children to the U.S. mainly for work, and high-profile cases of alleged immigrants avoiding deportation.\nLast week, U.S. prosecutors in San Diego began their cross-border task force to look at whether “aggressively law-abiding citizens” were behind a northbound migrant smuggling ring that pleaded guilty to charges including trafficking in people to China.\nBy early January, 85 percent of Americans now support an immigration policy that allows judges to arrest people who are convicted of a crime, making Mexico and Central America the next main target of illegal immigration, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.\nIt’s also likely that illegal immigrants not already on the U.S. deportation force will be the main focus of efforts to tackle the surge of Central American migrants.\n“A lot of people in countries that are used as war zones, that are looking for support from their neighbors — that’s why they want to go to the U.S.,” said David O‘Brien, an attorney at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.\n(Reporting by Steve Gorman and David Shepardson; Writing by Steve Gorman; Editing by Frank McGurty)\n""]"

""And we’ve got to make sure that hospitals get the best care.”\nThe governor noted that the same hospital he visited last week — a donor in a jar for his son who had pneumonia and was sent to a different hospital for pneumonia treatment — “missed nursing assistants … and cared for 66 patients” while he visited at the California Psychiatric Hospital in Keene.\nAs part of the governor’s request, hospitals are reimbursed for services related to respiratory and palliative care patients. A patient from the Department of Veterans Affairs Hospital in Sacramento was transferred to an ER in the middle of the night Monday after nurses found her dead after taking her to the hospital.\nDespite that since carestaff was sent to the hospital, the governor wrote his office that the state asked hospitals for lists of only physicians “whose health care will be safe for evaluation or to be performed in accordance with hospital risk assessments.”\nEach hospital has granted $5,000 apiece for each respiratory patient it thinks may have such high risk, but only for respiratory patients.\nWhen asked whether the medicines are purchased without verifying the accuracy of the data, Brown’s office replied that the companies responsible would collect and look for alternative treatments before making a decision.\nOver the past six years, the state has “counted up” about 800,000 patients with respiratory and respiratory pneumonia, from whom respiratory treatment can sometimes be halted.\nThe governor noted that he’s asked hospitals to approve setting up care teams at all hospitals to be a two-pronged approach: One as a first step would allow care providers to share best practices and guidelines; the other as a last step would allow care providers to say they can’t accept false positives.\n“It’s real and it’s very important, and it has got to get to a place where patients, all of a sudden, when they have pneumonia or other form of pneumonia, are allowed to breathe in their own beds,” Brown said.\nOn Wednesday, the Associated Press reported that California alone is asking about $64 million for care from hospitals in 2020.\nMedical regulators already have said they will reduce those levels of care by at least 30 percent over the next few years.\nCurrently, California hospitals are spending $62 million a year to treat patients with acute respiratory infections.\nAt the same time, California hospitals are also calling for a 14 percent increase in federal funds to pay for research to develop pneumonia treatments.\n']"
756,Americans will get an extra year to obtain their Real ID,"['WASHINGTON — Americans will get an extra year to obtain their full driver’s license, insurance and domestic status, as the Obama administration pledged Wednesday to do by summer 2018.\nMajor obstacles remain, including many lawmakers who say it is overly burdensome and potentially impossible to qualify.\nThe waiver puts a renewed pressure on lawmakers to pursue a simpler process and more flexibility.\n“It requires that everyone get an ID,” said Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., whose Texas district includes most of the state’s borders.\nDemocrats have pushed for the waiver in previous years but stopped short of demanding a large one, even though courts have rejected several such claims.\n“We now know that federal law requires a detailed basis for the expiration of U.S. driver’s licenses, including detailed, infrequently used, driver’s-license information for all citizens,” said Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, a bill sponsor.\nThe administration provided no timeline for the deadline, but noted that it had spent more than $50 million this year, including about $54 million in transportation projects.\nSome senior officials have questioned whether the request will be easily obtained.\nUnder the Visa Waiver Program, passports, birth certificates and Social Security numbers would require drivers’ parents or guardians. In addition, residents could have to show proof of citizenship before they would be able to apply for an automatic renewal. Those people would only have to show they did not have permanent resident status or to be a documented foreign national.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called the waiver to Iowa a “complex, but fair” requirement for American drivers and suggested the administration would use another petition to collect the necessary signatures.\nBefore the waiver deadline, at least 25 states were waiving driver’s licenses, insurance and domestic status because they have no paperwork and were too burdensome.

Bloomberg’s aides have denied they were paid to participate.\nThe lawsuit said the mayor’s campaign was upset that the events had been leaked from the file, which was set up by a lobbyist seeking to help “privately defend the interests of the taxpayers of New York City.”\nBloomberg won re-election in 2014, although his margins often slipped in contested statewide elections or lost on electoral grounds. The lawsuit said it was “disgusting” for the campaign to trumpet a fundraiser the first time such an event ever took place.\nUnder federal law, attorneys general “must act as anti-discrimination agents” and “impose the following penalties” if they see instances of fraud or failure to conduct business according to code.\n“For the mayor, this is another giveaway to endear him to his donors by giving an uncritical acceptance to an exercise in political campaign victory,” the lawsuit said.\nBut the suit asks for an accounting of the events that were attended by Bloomberg’s campaign staffers, including the $30,000 to $20,000 four-day party he hosted for campaign workers. It doesn’t specify how much the guests were reimbursed by donors.\nThe complaint also accuses the campaign of “accusing the plaintiff, the plaintiff’s counsel, and plaintiffs’ attorney of wrongdoing,” including a “full knowledge of and visible record that they had essentially no choice but to negotiate agreements with defendants” to trade anti-discrimination protections for refunds, forbearance, and other contractual terms that existed before the launch of the Bloomberg campaign.\n“The document, which was shown to plaintiff’s counsel, was made public when it was made public a few days before the city’s unofficial end of the campaign launch,” the lawsuit said.\nIt added that each of the plaintiffs’ employees asked to “relaunch” the campaign before they were contacted by a personal contact who wanted to “keep it simple and transparent so that the public could discern the nature of these agreements.”\n“During a time when six months prior to the launch of the mayor’s campaign, plaintiff had provided a list of hours on which previously paid employee came to appear at various appointments in the mayor’s office,” the lawsuit said.\nThe Bloomberg campaign has not responded to requests for comment.\n']"

It would give the president more freedom to shape immigration policy.\nTrump\'s blueprint would also bar Congress from indefinitely banning immigrants in the country illegally from coming to the United States, a move lawmakers and many activists have balked at, arguing the measure would add thousands of miles to the U.S.-Mexico border and result in a terrorist threat to the country.\nCongress last year passed a bill that would expand Obama-era policies which ""eliminate"" certain types of legal immigration from the country illegally, setting up a record 140,000 cases.\nIf the House and Senate want to move ahead, it would be up to the Trump administration to decide whether to expand those programs, something that is expected to be complicated if the Senate does not end its stopgap funding impasse.\nSanders said Trump was ""really frustrated with what\'s going on.""\n""He has grown very frustrated,"" she said, adding that she was hopeful a bill could be ""sort of on his plate"" for Friday\'s meeting.\nThe Justice Department last month declined to comment on the proposal, saying it was meant to run through an administrative review process under the federal courts\' jurisdiction.\nThe revised immigration policy also would curtail the diversity visa program, similar to other eligibility requirements under previous rounds of immigration restriction.\nSanders also declined to say whether Trump intended to withdraw the United States from an agreement with Iran that gives the country the right to limit Iranian oil exports under the deal.\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson said Tuesday it would be a ""huge mistake"" to leave, and reminded reporters that he said a pullout would likely target an agreement Iran reached with major powers over its nuclear program.\nMany U.S. lawmakers are trying to improve the program, which allowed for Iranian oil exports in the bargain with curbs on the ability of the other countries to enrich nuclear fuel. The deal Trump reached with the powers in March set up the procedure with the backing of Trump\'s own administration.\nOpponents to the current system warn that the deal could hamper economic growth as other countries lighten their efforts and end up running amok.\nThe legislation aims to increase the number of visas for businesses and individuals from about 4 million to 12 million annually over five years.\nIt would also give immigrant lawyers, lawyers, lawyers and other lawyers access to Trump\'s Office of Foreign Assets Control to review whether or not any foreign government was abusing its authority to interfere with the administration\'s operations.\nSanders said she did not know how many immigrants might be included in the revised visa program, and that she has discussed the numbers with Trump.\n']"

Republicans say the measures are part of President Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda and could undermine a process being proposed by House Republicans.\nThis week the Fed meets for a vote on a new, five-year plan to revive the economy that could include a tax overhaul. At the same time, Trump’s White House has said it’s “crucial” to approve his second major economic stimulus of the Trump era.\nAdvertisement\nThe uncertainty over tax reform and the timing of tax measures means confirmation of any potential tax overhaul could make the upcoming meeting a high-stakes test for the Trump administration and other Republican leaders.\nThe Grand Bargain Is Over\nLast month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin held the first of three meeting of the group, scheduled for this Wednesday and Thursday in Washington. The Trump administration is targeting the talks as a sign of progress in the talks, which began last summer.\nSince the former White House official left the Fed in mid-February, two weeks before the White House’s first annual vacation in October, officials are exploring how to send the plan to Trump, who has already signaled how he wants to make the best use of the tax law.\n“One of the things I hear our colleagues saying is that if they get the president onboard, this will be a helpful milestone,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, New York. “If you really need to do it, it would be a nice vehicle to make it happen.”\nDemocratic Senators\nA key element in that effort is Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s plan to amend the tax code. The Democratic legislative leader, Schumer, this week convened a subcommittee with some Republican colleagues and released a six-page proposal on the plan. The package would further triple corporate rates, but does not specify what it would do next.\nDemocratic members of the Ways and Means Committee are counting on the plan to pass by the end of this month and put the legislative process in motion, they say. Members of the Congressional Budget Office have long said they are largely supportive of the plan.\nAdvertisement\nA GOP aide in the House was skeptical that last year’s tax overhaul — the largest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in nearly a decade — would satisfy Democrats. But Republicans said the details were far too few and aimed primarily at adding to the already existing tax code, which has shrunk to $23 trillion.\nRepublicans, Democrats and consumer advocates estimate that up to 25 percent of the bill could be passed and subject to small incremental cuts that defray any costs.\nMarket Revisions\nIn an effort to renew the policy debate, House leaders are pressing President Donald Trump to make any changes to the tax code permanent.\nIn an interview with Boston Herald, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, R-Mich., told Politico that Trump should be able to, in effect, rewrite existing tax code without a rush of changes to the tax code. Camp’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been a vocal critic of the tax package, saying, “If a president of that stature and office couldn’t produce a really effective plan for seven years, good heavens, but in ten years,” he wrote to Trump this past week.\nAnalysts say whether the tax package will win approval from Republicans will likely depend on the timing of the talks. This year alone, Republicans have proposed cutting tax rates from 39.6 percent to 21 percent and cutting business rates from 35 percent to 15 percent — both of which would boost economic growth.\nTax reform is expected to be one of the top themes at this week’s meeting, with Trump expected to talk about tax reform more extensively at Wednesday’s meeting.\n— Associated Press\n']"

That decision would alter the legal landscape for local TV producers, who make the estimated $5 billion insurance bill in state and local taxes, and online streaming-services providers who have to dig into billions of dollars to add subscribers.\n""As the costs to the state are massive, the D.J. has already been claiming costs against state agencies across California that enter into similar, much-more costly contracts in the future,"" Justice Sandra Day O\'Connor wrote in her order. ""We will no longer be able to interpret California law to proceed against companies unless the agencies are able to conduct a comparative determination, which is a constitutional issue, in order to reduce the budgetary expenses, which may cause the federal government, (resolved in the same order by the Supreme Court in March 2019), to also receive an injunction from the D.J., thus providing for future litigation. Once we receive the agency\'s decision, we will then consider whether the state Supreme Court\'s injunction will stand.""\n( Also on POLITICO: Six things to know about the 2020 midterm elections)\nThe appellate court had previously held that the laws regulating such claims should be challenged, and defended the D.J., saying it was necessary to do so to streamline that effort.\nThe law now in place on behalf of the state is a section titled ""force of contract requirements"" that was established in 2008. Both the state and the federal governments have deemed those sections unconstitutional.\nThe development leaves the appeals court with the responsibility of determining whether the statute is admissible in new cases brought by new and existing TV producers with new or existing legal opinions under the new law.\n""The D.J. is not required to participate in the arbitration proceedings designed to determine eligibility for the arbitration arbitration program,"" Barrett wrote in the ruling. ""And because this panel is not fully empowered to require arbitration arbitration, the court must proceed to assess whether the statute meets the criteria envisioned by the Legislature. The court therefore considers the Legislature\'s legislation a failure, from the very beginning, to provide for a continuing collection of the alternative award of up to $25,000,000 for errors.""\nThe appeals court also said the Legislature could ""assess the sentence and maximum sentence imposed by the statute to determine whether a fair and reasonable alternative award of $25,000,000 is fair and reasonable in the event of a direct or indirect treatment outside a monetary award of up to $25,000,000,"" and said that if that were done, ""excessive enforcement of the statute could lead to a disparate impact for non-discriminatory, exclusive, equitable or selective purposes.""\nThis story has been updated to clarify the degree of the “right to arbitration” provision.\n( Also on POLITICO: Fast food CEOs sue Michigan over tax change)\n']"

But there was no equivalent for the pandemic vaccines after the aforementioned round of vaccines, and how the failures of the vaccine sector and the government did not affect the health of the population much.\n“By reducing costs, including delaying and then ceasing the vaccine production cycle, there is a minimal downside,” Kroeker said.\nAs of now, the potential has largely been mitigated by funding towards tackling the global pandemic, and the fact that the vaccine sector is important not only to medical research, but also to the strengthening of internal organs.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., faces a challenge right now: To get a woman elected to the U.S. Senate she\'d better go through the primaries and win by a margin large enough to satisfy major interest groups.\nWarren has the advantage of speaking well of liberal colleges, more conservative members of Congress and networks that make for strong, if not critically important, candidates for president. But this may not be enough if Warren has to run unopposed for president, she says. Her 2013 campaign against Sen. Bernie Sanders, R-Vt., raised close to $200 million, among the most in politics, and divided activists and GOP activists.\nHer conservative-leaning platform is in sync with the bipartisan liberal agenda of President Obama and many conservatives. She makes a case that it is time for a change, even though she is a Republican and doesn\'t want to stand on his side.\nWarren is therefore not alone in her thinking. Her liberal coalition is even larger than Hillary Clinton\'s — an all-but-certain opponent to Trump — and there is a lot to worry about with an incumbent Democratic president. Clinton is running for re-election in an unprecedented third term as a liberal on one of America\'s most consequential issues, health care. She must go through a hard campaign.\nPresident Barack Obama has drawn far more female votes in his four terms as president than most Americans know.\nWith women voters closing the key, more than 80 percent of the nation\'s public college graduates vote Republican, Warren said in a Tuesday interview. Five years ago, only 35 percent of male college graduates voted for Obama. But during his first three terms, women outvoted Republicans, and Obama won an overall majority of the vote with the help of a ""voter mobilization"" program, Brown University News Service reported.\nShe\'s wrong to assume that she can overcome a crowd of largely female college graduates. But she will.\n""I\'ll be setting myself up for something big, and I\'m putting myself out there to do something big. We\'re going to see firsthand,"" Warren said. ""I want someone that can knock on doors, reach out to women. I want women who want to vote at the state and local level. ... I want to know that a woman can do it. I want to know that women look at us as a country. I want women to feel powerful as a country.""\nWarren said she supports the Democratic Party\'s 2016 presidential bid against Hillary Clinton, saying she would run with ""a real, proven progressive agenda.""\nBut wouldn\'t that have worked? Warren has already said that she wouldn\'t. Plus, there\'s something to that. She is not just a Democrat running for a Republican. Her Republican opponents are too. The Democrats have the same liberal base and it will be a challenge for Warren to add the female support she needed to break free from a Republican insurgency.\nYes, she does raise awareness of issues and matters important to women, but often that helps Clinton make the case she can be a formidable contender. The next president must have little doubt on her qualifications and national security credentials. Trump could derail that agenda by inflaming divisions among the divided Democratic Party. That\'s not to say she can\'t defeat a Republican. The issue of abortion, for example, does have an inextricable link to Trump\'s platform, and a liberal agenda could backfire if a Democratic president does or doesn\'t, with moderate men.\nBut not in Warren\'s time, let alone on this very controversial issue. She\'s too big a target and needs an African-American, which is a major cultural and social challenge for an inexperienced, inexperienced party president.

Or is it Australia’s ideological crunch?\nIt seems to be.\nIs government going down the path of extreme self-interest?\nSome of us will closely examine each day what it stands to take to achieve sensible decisions in the future.\nThere were already so many risks posed to Australia’s place in the world that it did not get the right deal.\nThe Federal Government’s biggest transfer of new revenue that it has ever seen has seen more than $25 billion flowed to Japanese crisis debt.\nIf all goes well, almost the entire government’s new package would be written down by about half. That means that, without equity, the Prime Minister’s budget would be stuck forever.\nFor now, the Australian economy looks as healthy as ever.\nThat was the discovery of that rare new commodity, the OJ syndrome, in the world yesterday.\nFor those who hold interest in Australia’s track record, the results are worrying: most of the growth for its economy has come since 2013.\nIn recent months, with a lower freight rate of about $4 a tonne the freight costs Australia above most economies in the OECD and less than half the revenue levels of the OECD average, but rising inflation of about 6 per cent and unemployment of 6.5 per cent, the Australian economy was growing at its fastest rate since 1985.\nAll of which raises new questions about the greatness of the Australian economy. The Reebok (O’Neill) float has come with a raft of headline decisions.\nIs it a case of Australia gouging public spending for those government promises to generate growth?\nFar more important is the outcome of Senate deliberations.\nThis session marks the 11th or 12th time that the Senate has rejected what is known as Section 96.\nThis was first introduced by the Scott Morrison government in 2007. A year later, it got way below 100. Now, it rises to 95.\nThe issue is whether Sections 96 is a credible tool in confronting those wishing to drive the economy.\nThis last vote was to blame for a weak economy.\nIf Section 96 is irrelevant this time around, what should be a greater concern is the end of the Tasmanian political impasse and the prospect of changes in coal mining legislation in the Senate?\nMorrison and his finance minister, Christine Milne, are busy trying to salvage a television campaign that blames the Turnbull government’s leadership for the budget crisis.\nI think they have a greater dilemma than the sun is setting.\nWhat will happen if there is not enough reform before the end of next year?\nThere is not a clear-cut answer.\nThe small opposition Greens is not on the political fence on the matter but have stated a preference to avoid intervention in the final debate by holding hearings.\nAnd the establishment party of the crossbench senators has pledged to protect that objective if forced to vote.\nThis is our concern.\nThe Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has been unamused by numerous defeats to roll-out legislation that would have incorporated and augmented knowledge-based data and identity and contributed to Australia’s cross-party deficit financing deal in 2015.\nNothing remarkable about its recent rulings.\nInstead, this latest decision is recognition that the ABS did not foresee that federal spending in 2016-17 would last more than two years, or that the huge state level budget deficit in Victoria would continue until the end of 2024.\nSo the anxiety that once again found its way to Australia’s politicians was greatly enhanced.\nBut the bigger question is whether the Federal Government has the spine to lead us back to economic health.\nFollow Eric Duhatschek on Twitter @Eric_Duhatschek\n']"

Only 42 percent of the cats and dogs that have been exposed to the disease have been found to pass it on, USDA statistics show.\nAlong with the millions of Americans suffering from a common cold, the virus has emerged most quickly in heavy rainstorms and rising temperatures.\nSix people were hospitalized in the British Columbia-Cambridge, Ont., area in late 2017, according to the province’s health department.\n“By now it’s been reported to us that over 80% of individuals and more than 400 pets have acquired it,” said state health spokeswoman Jennifer Frissora.\nSome housekeepers and owners saw bigger food-related problems than they realized, including dog-tooth infections, an illness of birds in the kennels and pets being injured with feces spills.\n“These sounds like a lot of nothing — especially for the habit-forming dogs,” said Animal Care Supervisor Meghan Ouimet, who described the experience of several dozen dogs bitten by the parasite in late December.\nA petition headed to Health Canada, the Canadian Medical Association and a fan website claiming the vaccination already prescribed in the U.S. is safe and effective.\n“The good news is at this point, the vaccine has been evaluated for effectiveness,” said USDA spokesman Mike Zimmerman, commenting on the petition.\nThe Trump administration said Wednesday its efforts were only in coordination with health regulators.\n“In light of the extraordinarily high incidence of [chronic] colds in the United States in recent years, it’s important for the federal government to work together to help prevent, diagnose and treat these diseases,” said Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue.\nThough the state agricultural department and USDA said the disease was circulating in various parts of Pennsylvania and other U.S. states, they called to see whether CDC researchers have been personally working with the institute that monitors chronic diseases in the country and were interested in data-driven studies.\nNo such studies were scheduled.\nFor more than a week now, we’ve said some people should be wary of a parasite. Those warnings have led public calls for an end to the practice of cramming pets in sealed bags and footstools in our homes or offices for research.\nThe FAA has also strongly said it won’t allow pet owners to wash their dogs at the urging of veterinary departments because feces-spreading illnesses can cost up to $3,000 per pet.\nThe fun of the zoo: We are encouraged that Obama — after a long fall and a purge of communists around the world — was elected.\nThe cost of living increased around the country amid the Trump administration’s harsh immigration policies.\nAnd vaccines are for a growing population.\nAs the climate goes, so goes medicine.\ndchen@postmedia.com\ntwitter.com/demigaille\n']"

770,"COVID-19 doctors running out of masks? Try a bandanna, the CDC says","['× COVID-19 doctors running out of masks? Try a bandanna, the CDC says\nNEW YORK — A new study has found that first responders are developing headaches during using bandages on live targets that reveal more about the danger of a life-threatening blood clot than they initially thought.\nIt’s a big deal, because the CDC Health Sciences Division reports 31 million Americans have blood clots. Physicians have paid billions of dollars for defibrillators to replace the electrical shock system used in hospitals and emergency rooms, and foam against slings to increase life-threatening blood clotting.\nScientists wanted to find out how much blood clots could be clots compared to what the watchfully monitored SCUBA blood test showed. Now, a new study from a clinic in Southern California suggests that exercising bandages with slings significantly increases the risk.\n“For first responders, an active bandage can lower blood levels of free radical (FH) lipopolysaccharide, also known as the ‘scratch gene,’ or a clot that leads to a small, but life-threatening, blood clot,” said study author Dr. Joel Bilhaj, director of the Torriborg and W.L. Wenke Center for Vascular Medicine at the University of Washington, in a statement.\nEssentially, the syringe containing a bandage or a gel is connected to a machine that conducts a blood test to measure blood clot freeness.\nThe test produces blood clots that are particularly deadly in indoor and outdoor environments.\nBut the study has found that using bandages of sand without masking serum phlegm could boost levels of the clot risk significantly.\nBandages of 1,00-2470 cells remove fluid from the blood and therefore potentially reduce clot-producing blood clots. By this amount, there is a 0.04 percent chance that all blood and skin grafts — called resorbs — will be affected by a disease that is more deadly in people with the genetic material inherited from a parent.\n“Bandages of 1,000 cells will also increase the chance of a more deadly clot. It’s the only blood type that can block these factors,” Bilhaj said.\nBut if blood systems don’t go on-site for a week or two, then cutting out bandages of 1,000 cells will only worsen a clot. But new studies are piling up indicating that bandages of 1,000 cells will greatly increase the risk of a clot.\n']"
771,California’s final presidential primary results may be delayed due to coronavirus,"['LANCASTER, Pa. (AP) — In one of the biggest tests in presidential politics, Tuesday’s California primary has turned out to be even more brutal than previously believed.\nCalifornia voters convened at polling stations in a tight race between Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown and Republican Donald Trump, who is the state’s most popular politician and often has low approval ratings. The state’s electorate has been lean, snowy and dry, and many people began lining up in the last few minutes to vote in the final days of the contest.\n“There’s just so much damage to do,” said Jonathan Anderson, a Republican from Palm Springs. “We’re sending out so many messages that it’s practically a one-day fix.”\nThe switchover occurred two days after a flu season — a grim reality the race is again playing out.\nBoth Brown and Trump’s campaigns are promoting the final day to portray California as a redoubt of Russian influence during the 2016 campaign. The California Republican Party later played down the possibility of an uptick in turnout, saying events like the California primary usually play havoc with voter turnout.\nSome polls have showed an uptick in the race, but it hasn’t gone as far as anticipated. The vote was moved from the evening of February 26 to the day after the California primary. The California Democratic Party has released a updated version of a poll it mailed out that showed Brown taking 46 percent of the vote, up from his 43 percent three weeks ago.\nTrump hasn’t won the national nomination process, and hasn’t exactly gained the nation’s largest bloc of voters. But he’s still expected to win over Democrats and populists.\nTrump has campaigned in California in recent days, beginning with a trip to the state last week. A television ad he ran for state Senate in January concluded: “California will not be deserted by Trump.”\nBut there were some close calls Tuesday, however. Brown’s star turn may have been due to his fourth-place finish in Tuesday’s primary, when the five Democrat backers of California Sen. Barbara Boxer were recognized with not just state Sen. Jeff Flake’s support but also California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who showed up to defeat another Democrat — former Gov. Pete Wilson — to seek a second term.\nWilson, who was in the governor’s mansion for the primary and moved into a Capitol building near his campaign headquarters, won the nomination Tuesday.\n“It’s one thing to lose, but it’s another to advance a candidate and represent the interest of the American people,” Newsom said.\nHe endorsed Brown in a joint appearance with his GOP opponent.\nLawrence DuBois, a Libertarian presidential nominee, said his goal is to help California’s voters better understand how the Democratic Party affects the state.\n“California has been knocked down by some very, very serious challenges,” DuBois said. “We’re going to have to convince Californians that they, too, have moved on to other areas.”\nStill, some Californians said they didn’t agree with Trump’s recent statements and appeared to be voting against him, citing issues such as his foreign policy policies and the shrinking state’s relatively small economy.\nAmong those voting Tuesday, there was skepticism that Trump would win the GOP nomination and why California should be viewed as ripe for American withdrawal from the global trading and support system set up to seal trade with China.\n“My wife called me the other day and she says, ‘Are you guys really so realistic?’ She goes, ‘Don’t you worry. There is such a perfect voter base, the most important bloc.’ She wasn’t very happy to hear the president deny it,” said Catalina Zaremberg, a Democrat from San Diego.\nThe race could be worse with a pneumonia and flu that left Brown, a Marine who has run twice before in elections, in poor health.\nHis doctor sent him home with antibiotics Tuesday and given him plenty of fluids so he could get back to running.\n“If I was a governor, I would be on antibiotics,” he said, wearing his arm loose.\n']"

The virus has only been found in a few places around the state, according to the USDA’s recent World Health Organization document on coronavirus.\nAs you can see in the release, the largest category of influenza people in 2018 has so far died, with 184 people infected. The deaths are likely to include a 20 percent global spread because the virus hasn’t been tested in specific people.\nThere are also cases in Oregon and California.\nOf the 12 California counties affected, most by the coronavirus disease die of some sort of acute respiratory illness, an important criteria for vaccination, and some people have high odds of contracting the disease. According to the state agency, which includes Santa Barbara, Mission Bay, and Orange County, early cases in 2016 were normal through most of the year.\nThe state does not have an official coronavirus vaccination program. Public health officials who worked with public health and health education have said it is too early to tell the full effects of the outbreak and the public can consider it a public health emergency.\nMichael Sanders, a public health epidemiologist with Santa Barbara’s public health agency, said California’s coronavirus outbreak so far, “has a powerful message. And it is having an impact worldwide.”\nMeanwhile, despite health officials’ efforts to shut the virus down in California, the virus remains in the health care system in California. And new data are crucial in forcing lawmakers and scientists to come up with strategies to ease the spread of the virus by curbing the spread of epidemics like the one in Texas.\nIn a letter Friday to the Senate Appropriations Committee, Public Health Health Secretary Diara McMahon encouraged lawmakers to “not delay funding needed to protect the public and improve access to vaccines, and discourage the virus from emerging in California.”\nShe added that California could become a leader in the fight against the virus by allowing the public to more easily access the virus. McMahon called that option a “myth.”\n“We are concerned this isn’t a win-win situation for all of us,” she said.\n“This isn’t about state health. It’s about public health,” McMahon added.\nStill, the question remains: Is California’s coronavirus problem still a future issue? There is some hope that the California Public Health Agency of Health, with partnership with the state Department of Public Health, could spark a debate about the wisdom of waiting to allow people to get vaccinated.\nCalifornia Republicans in the state legislature are working with lawmakers on California Gov. Jerry Brown’s plan to allow people to get the flu vaccine, which is widely used in hospitals and is shown to avoid an illness like the virus that killed four people in 2005.\nOn Jan. 4, Brown told the California Senate health committee that the state was getting more than 300,000 the shot in 2017. It is set to continue to grow next year at between 250,000 and 300,000, but Sen. Sean Kearns said earlier this week that he wasn’t aware of reports that one of those people likely hadn’t gotten enough the shot to make it a valid public health emergency.\n""]"

The personnel shall include senior civil servants,” it said.\nThe purpose of the Corps of Engineers is to retrieve old properties of old structures as part of the rehabilitation programme. This will see improved amenities for people and the environment.\nThe deadline to complete the rehabilitation programme has been March 31, but it is expected to be just a few days before the status of Hajj pilgrims.\nIndia’s three biggest oil refineries are usually idle.

775,Lawmakers race to reach coronavirus stimulus deal despite disagreements over checks to taxpayers,"['OTTAWA — Canadians spent $375,000 on air travel last year — the highest amount the federal government has spent for air travel since 2005 — as lawmakers scrambled to reach a deal to extend a controversial federal health overhaul.\nBut that extra federal cost was borne largely by Canadians.\n“It’s inappropriate to list and say that we spent $375,000 just to keep everyone going,” said Senate Conservative Whip Marc Garneau, noting that air travel accounts for more than a third of all air travel transactions, compared to almost 70 per cent as a percentage of total travel expenditures.\nGarneau and his colleagues are running a retooled federal health care platform to help taxpayers with health costs. Their plans contain three new investments made to help Canadians — new vehicle emission standards for taxis, a new financial system for tax-free enterprise financing, and restrictions on gun ownership for Canadians.\nThe plan also involves a plan to set up a new provider identification program for Saskatchewan high-risk individuals.\nThe data on the the federal spending is intended to offset Canadians’ growing medical costs. But Marc Gold, a Calgary lawyer who sits on the Senate health committee, said that the cost — estimated at around $300,000 — was well behind schedule and that the House had to borrow millions to get through its lobbying year.\n“It was very difficult,” he said. “And it’s only putting up somewhat.”\nRich Greenbush, legislative director for health resources at the Canadian Medical Association, said it was important for the union to see the plan as it was developed.\n“Their education is going to benefit our provinces as well,” he said.\nThe policy support tool — an acronym for Comprehensive Care Improvement — would include consideration of each province’s physical infrastructure needs.\nGreenbush said TransCanada, TransCanada’s rail rival, plans to use such a tool for planning Canada’s infrastructure, which Greenbush said would be especially helpful for transportation hubs in rural Saskatchewan and in remote areas.\nThe NDP also recently issued its own health care plan, one that aims to implement a replacement to the Affordable Care Act — laws that the federal government says benefit the provinces.\nLast week, the NDP released its version of that bill, which calls for closer coordination between the provinces and hospitals.\nBut Greenbush said the only reason Ottawa is seeking more money is for making small changes in health care, such as failing to provide care to patients or expanding services.\nHe said his group would give a different if temporary measure for a federal health overhaul that would provide support to provinces or cities where they already have too much bureaucracy.\n“We don’t want to talk about anything that’s not desirable in the eyes of the federal government,” he said.\nEven though there are growing concerns about federal finances, it’s possible the funding can be passed on to the provinces, Greenbush said.\nThe Conservatives are believed to have extended the foreign aid bill, which expires at the end of this year, for two years. Both parties must also agree to fund the program for a third year.\nThe $300,000 budget would have been based on the state of health in Canada and represents 10 per cent of the total spending on health care in the United States.

The Senate Intelligence Committee has released a report that recommends the existence of Senate Intelligence Committee’s internal investigations into the allegations of an earlier failed PAC computer hacking investigation.\nWASHINGTON — FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers that the Central Intelligence Agency is headed to independent investigations into allegations of election interference in the Trump presidency and whether someone “misspoke” or “decreed” in reporting to the American Security Investigations Agency.\n“I believe that we must continue to follow these matters closely,” Comey said in remarks at a Senate panel meeting.\nPressed on whether he ever doubted there was something suspicious with the information being gathered about the funds and other files, Comey replied: “It’s been evaluated.”\nThe committee voted last week to conduct an internal investigation into whether US intelligence agencies unlawfully or improperly allowed the FBI and the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee to access certain records concerning five of its current and former staffers from the Trump campaign.\nThe committee is looking into whether the Office of Management and Budget improperly excluded the DOJ from a previous internal investigation into possible conflicts of interest between former President Donald Trump aide Andrew McCabe and McCabe’s predecessor, former FBI Director James Comey.\nComey then opened the investigation to the broadest possible range of interviews. He said he was confident he would be able to uncover both issues, but added that the Obama administration, under Comey’s oversight, had cleared a covert oversight case.\nAs part of his probe, Comey also took additional public action to investigate the fallout from Mueller’s bombshell report on former FBI director James Comey’s emails and the agency’s response to the release of his own emails.\n“The inquiry is presently in final stages of final analysis,” Comey said.\nThe probe comes as the Trump administration details tough trade policies that threaten an American recovery from recession.

779,A disaster foretold: Shortages of ventilators and other medical supplies have long been warned about,"['British researchers of computer science have developed another guide to predicting catastrophe when climate change brings unpredictable spikes in the greenhouse gas emissions of humans and animals.\nThey have made a new research paper entitled ‘A disaster forecasting framework that avoids understanding climate change’.\nAcross 23 datasets between 1901 and 1955, 14 identified the ‘seismic event’ of a sudden change in temperature above or below normal over some stretch of high-pressure inland land.\nPrevious research has found that disruption to weather patterns occurs only once in the history of the climate system and that limiting production of that variable before a slight change in the climate causes possible interruptions of drought and industrialised land and water supply, causing future extreme weather disasters.\nThe new paper, by Niels Sperling, better understands climate change, and proposes a comprehensive set of explanatory models to forecast the future future.\nIn a paper published in Nature Communications on Friday, the researchers present possible evidence for predicting environmental disaster using a model of a sophisticated 18th century blizzard forecast and simulate scenarios, modelling rainfall anomalies (temperature changing) and other factors to arrive at a model.\nSperling explained: “We can simulate a disruption of those weather patterns by following the frequent variations in the temperature of various regions during different seasons.\n“We can also propose natural responses to these natural changes, such as a small number of or no changes in the climate at a particular time in the year in which the storm typically appeared.”\nHow exactly the environment is affected by natural events\nComparative models (switches) can identify significant changes in climate as they vary in intensity and severity, and could answer one of three questions:\n2- To determine the intensity of intense temperature change in one of two categories: rainfall\nExaminations show more rapid warming observed in areas where rainfall has been relatively little warmer, such as the Arctic, where it has grown for a longer period.\nExaminations can measure the degree of warming observed in large areas and other areas in which rainfall has been relatively mild, compared with elsewhere.\nA greater number of rainfall fluctuations can be linked to heavy coastal damage and higher prices on natural gas drilling, the researchers say.\nTheir model emphasises that the difference between rainfall variation in the Atlantic and Pacific seaboard regions, and the Pacific coastal region in which the sun shines every day, are distinct, and not entirely independently managed.\n“We can (or it could) predict the overall climate at any time in the future. For example, the climate is likely to change substantially over a period of decades from now,” Sperling said.\n“At this point we think the climate is going to change so dramatically that we could attribute that to the rapid rise in global temperatures.\n“Then it would be like another price variable. We could say something about how it is going to change over time, but at this point we don’t know. But at this point we can guarantee that it will happen, as we can predict that.”\nIn detail\nThe paper identifies a number of climate models and mathematical models, and provides an overview of the population of extreme weather models which can account for complex weather variations across large regions.\nSperling said: “A key driver of our models is [that] we understand human behavior.”\nHe explained: “As we look at humans, every single one of our relatives (humans) has an influence on climate. Now we have a study showing that this influence can and should be a key factor in climate shifts.”\nCaitlin Brard, a scientist at Cambridge University and a member of the research team, said: “Surveys have shown a dramatic increase in global warming temperatures over the last 20 years — particularly the rising of the Earth’s base heating — but long-term changes do not show up until long after we have been asleep.”\nThe paper comes as scientists reveal more warming is being recorded in the Arctic and seas, with some suggesting polar bear populations had risen 17 per cent since 1998.\nScientists have warned of warming of more than 11 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, potentially ending the longest ice age on record.\n']"
780,Column: The coronavirus crisis shows what happens when a country puts its workers last,"['Every last development and contraction can send a shudder through the world and cause unease among us all. This miseries is starting to spread and now seems to be happening more and more in the UAE. There have been three recent fatal epidemics of coronavirus.\nSaudi Arabia, Pakistan and Yemen have all identified and reported problems, with deaths and sicknesses have been prevalent for decades. The people of these countries know the virus and are horrified at the symptoms.\nBesides, these countries have to come up with a vaccine or anti-viral therapy for meningitis, pneumococcal disease and tuberculosis. Within the first ten months of outbreak, several regions of the world will have a vaccine. When the pandemic is under control, it may become apparent that this system of immunity is not working efficiently.\nIt would be a mistake to assume that diseases like coronavirus will increase in that part of the world, particularly on a country level. In that region, the virus is easily spread, given the relatively few infectious organisms among the employees of the companies.\nA case is already reported in recent weeks in the UAE, where a company manufactures a product in an incubator.\nAn earlier report from International Herald Tribune on April 1 claimed that there had been an outbreak of pneumonia in the UAE and two cases of chicken pox within three weeks. It is unclear whether the virus is in the UAE or abroad. Two workers have already been removed from the work as a result of the closure.\nThe news was to add to the already under-reported and stonewalled health ministry statement which said: “A confirmed case of pneumonia has been recorded in a female male employee of Alvita unit at Jabalah Centre Hospitals in Sharjah.” The source was quoted by the private news agency Dubai News Agency.\nNo surprise is the cause of the pertussis, so far. An international standard test is already under way to discover if the virus is present in the countries of the UAE and the other countries.\nThe harsh response of the health ministry, indeed in several places, has also hit the morale of the employees who depend on them. Wahhabism Muslims are believed to be a group responsible for the mortality among Saudis. Many Saudi families in particular depend on the workers, and so this is particularly worrying.\nI was briefly asked why some organisations are not asking for recommendations or advisory services for infection control when the public health profession is critical.\nThe primary benefits of this issue are that these workers can communicate with their families – who make up the bulk of the kingdom’s employees – and can prepare a better way for victims of the Pandemic.\nLast year there were 166 reports of measles, 17 fatal infections and 19 deaths across the country. The vaccine has already been in a production-related bind for some time now.\nAs a good example, the recent date when patients who had pertussis visited their hospitals, some still with symptoms as of last week, means that some of them still have not succumbed to the infection.\nThe US embassy in Dubai said in a statement on March 20: “We recognize, however, that this recent addition to the Pandemic Information Service are serious public health concerns.”\nIn some hospitals, patients said they had not fully recovered from their ordeal and some of the patients were again in need of immediate help. In the past, these patients, when either had major injuries or were unable to leave their area, relied on case histories and locally contracted diseases in order to survive.\nThe shortage of quality, compassionate care workers is another matter altogether. It is doubtful that the employees at the Alvita clinic in the UAE can cope with the burden of the epidemic.\nIn the United States, where the epidemics have been managed better, one of the best-known collapses of the US health system occurred in 2007.\nWe have been rocked by this crisis, and more and more countries will suffer the very repercussions of the sub-mergence.\nLabour agencies in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, as well as the government, are operating independently, and blame human rights violations on every side.\nWe want to learn from what has happened to all of us in the United States and its devastating consequences. And to help the UAE fight the crisis head-on. We will do more of that.\n(Pamela Zabel is a writer and mother of three.)\n']"
781,"As lawmakers begin falling ill from coronavirus, Congress may move to remote work","['WASHINGTON — The deadly coronavirus that’s the kind that almost shut down a plane for a week in the United States in 2017 — is especially dangerous and raises questions about whether rural doctors, clinics and other patients will be enough to help get the virus past susceptible rural patients.\nThe end of an era is a relief for the rural healthcare industry. Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia have not reported a case of coronavirus in four years. Among those who have: Pennsylvania, Idaho, Wyoming and Wisconsin.\nThe reason? Those rural hospitals have been unable to travel to remote areas for tests, or have largely failed to raise prices, said Dr. Philip Peters, president of the Indiana Association of Hospitals and Clinics.\nRelated Coverage Potential disease of memory loss: What happens when people die or do not recognize signs?\n“A lot of rural hospitals have definitely become unresponsive,” Peters said.\nChanges are coming for rural care. The Washington-based HEAL Institute, a regional public-health association, is issuing a report late this week warning that rural healthcare is understaffed, and that more cases of infection will be discovered in later months.\nClinics are routinely unresponsive and have poor blood-pumping and radiation- and antiseptic-liquid space for patients with elevated blood pressure, according to the survey, done by the Mercer consulting firm. Virginia’s Department of Health cited public health problems of its own, including radiation and pancreatic cancer.\n“Our industry is still struggling,” said Richard Quentzen, chairman of the ISCI board of directors.\nThe business side of health care is getting a lot younger. Twenty-five percent of employees in Washington are 59 or older, compared with 20 percent in New York and Washington state, according to industry members. In other rural areas, only about 15 percent are married or single, while 30 percent have a household income of less than $40,000, according to the Mercer survey.\n“County doctors, who are depending upon rural patients to make up their time, they are not going to be able to do that,” Peters said.\nHospitals are being sharply out of money. D.C. Hospitals’ uninsured rate has risen to 11 percent. They fell to 7.5 percent last year in their own states. In Wisconsin, it’s 6.5 percent.\n']"
782,"L.A. County confirms 61 new coronavirus cases, says median age among all patients is 47","['While modern burial techniques ensure fair treatment and privacy, the California health department says about 61 new coronavirus cases have been reported, up two percent from 42 new cases in 2016.\nThe data make the change seen in recent years only in the largest and most severe cases: a coronavirus called Clostridium difficile, which purports to be spreading naturally.\nBut a Centers for Disease Control (CDC) report released on Tuesday highlights recent changes to the way coronavirus screening is conducted. While coronavirus screening has ended in the 1970s, an estimated 40,000 men and women are still on HIV testing each year, the CDC found.\nAdvertisement\nAs a result, about 43 percent of the 21,000 deaths in California from the deadly bloodstream infections do not result from HIV.\nChildren are a particularly vulnerable group in the study, making up 43 percent of the victims; 54 percent of the victims are under the age of 18.\nWhat is being noted is that 8 percent of people who come into contact with the virus die. That is much lower than the average of 41 percent, which is meant to be counted as half-life.\nThe new data provide a new perspective on the spread of infectious diseases.\nThe CDC says in a report this month that 678 people have died worldwide from the two leading causes of death from the virus. Of that number, 763 have been killed by cholera.\nOne health care provider acknowledged that emergency-room surveillance and mental health care screenings have largely helped bring the number of cases to more patients.\nOn its website, the CDC says deaths from Dera Blaquil, a disease that has not been seen on a clinical level in a long time, have dropped from 181 in 2011 to 103 last year.\nNot all of the Dera Blaquil cases involve high-risk treatment, however. Once the disease is diagnosed, it is best to stay in the same hospital all the way to one of the controlled wards, said Dr. Kenja Ortega, a preventive nurse in the Community Healthcare\'s office in downtown Los Angeles.\nShe says that those diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis are in a better position to stay home. That is where prevention measures can help increase a person\'s chances of survival.\n""The most important thing is, during high risk events, you need to be smart about your watch,"" Ortega said.\nAntibiotics also play a role when screening, with lead exposure standard three to five times more than drugs combined.\nDr. Stephanie Bento, a school nurse in St. Thomas, said she has seen a gradual decrease in Dera Blaquil cases this year because of the drug treatment programs for people diagnosed at moderate risk.\nShe and other health care providers also emphasize hospital wellness programs that help people begin to put the message to others about getting rid of the virus.\nThe CDC report explains that 48 percent of Dera Blaquil cases have been reported to health care providers. Of those, an astounding 71 percent were to talk with a health care provider. That’s because health care providers are the people seeking the most protection from the virus.\nA CHANGE in the way the county surveys the risk of an infection is moving the CDC forward toward adopting a \'five stars\' rating, which comes from when a patient is reported to be at least five years old, before any real harm occurs.\nNot all procedures need to be followed in order to be seen on an individual patient list. Basic tissue samples will be screened for vaccines, with the potential to be ingested and identified through blood testing.\nMORE LINKS ON THE CDC CONTEXT\n']"
783,Trump administration ratchets up advisory: Avoid international travel,"['The Trump administration issued a series of new travel advisories on Monday in an effort to address concerns about “declining momentum” amid the implementation of an aggressive, ongoing push to build national monuments.\nThe new warning was issued by the Office of Management and Budget, which represents the Office of Management and Budget. The Office of Management and Budget defines a wide range of weather impacts, including inland flooding, coastal flooding and seepage, climate change, and fall, drought, flood and other pressures on vulnerable areas.\nWhile the groups calling for bans on Chinese visitors to the U.S. this fall attest to the closures, the new warnings, sponsored by the U.S. Geological Survey, look different.\nIn a statement Monday, the BLM cautioned, “If summer starts to look like a long-term trend, it would be regrettable for other facilities to lose revenue or even live off the plows.” It called on the Trump administration “to alleviate the great uncertainty, provide full access to local historic assets, implement temporary local economic impacts estimates, and work to provide preparation in case of emergency.”\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nOther funds earmarked for enhanced local economic impact estimates include those already covered by a $4 billion Trump-crafted fund. The fund, announced in December, states that if the federal government cannot immediately fill gaps in income-based tax funding for certain projects, the revenue received by those projects would be “disappointing.”\nThe funds aren’t expected to be part of the administration’s 2019 budget, since only a handful of projects cover the general-purpose economic impacts.\nThe state of Alabama has the biggest scope for designated environmental impacts with fewer than 35 percent funding, according to the State Department’s 2016 state budget request. However, that does not include projects dealing with “topography effects on coastal areas in this state and in other areas,” as the State Department recommends.\nTexas faces its own tough drive to recover from devastating coastal flooding, though its revenue is lower, and this year’s budget proposal warns that its costs “would result in fewer agency offices and the Department responsible for managing and public education’s budgetary priorities.”\nThe Trump administration is putting in place controversial changes to monuments and other public infrastructure, such as an immigration enforcement approach that instead puts more money into conservation and storage reserves.\nIn February, Vice President Mike Pence said $1 billion worth of projects could cost the federal government less than $1 billion since the change was announced in January.\nAmin Khan, executive director of the National Park Service, said, “If I was going to risk alienating the millions of state and local residents of our states and cities, or driving them all farther north or farther south, we do not want our federal government to simply build walls and cover sensitive places. Our job is not only to enhance the value of our national parks, but also to protect our natural habitats and natural resources.”\n——\nFollow Barna Lehthta Nussbaum-Lamar Jackson on Twitter: https://twitter.com/barnasbaumlamar\n——\nFollow Barna Lehta Nussbaum-Lamar Jackson on Twitter: https://twitter.com/barnasbaumlamar\n']"

785,"Trump touts unproven coronavirus remedies, drawing a diplomatic correction","['WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump tweeted Wednesday that a liver cancer mutation that he says leads to a decline in bladder cancer has been attributed to genetically modified cases of the disease.\nThe president’s own recent comments on a test provided by Michigan researchers had been attributed to two cases of liver cancer that were linked to risky immune tolerance screening, but all of the cases were not related.\nThe president was speaking on an unrelated topic: his recent tax overhaul, which he has heralded as “the greatest tax reform ever done” without having spelled out whether it helps pay for it with tax cuts.\nSpeaking in the Oval Office, the president said he worries a “small number” of patients have “many labels” on “alcohol and drugs” used to test for the viruses. He named three “toila” screens he says provide “enough information” to improve physicians’ ability to detect early signs of a severe form of liver cancer.\nHealth officials say many patients will not have access to either screening and know how their disease will develop, and government researchers are working with the industry on ways to test for those diseases.\nOf the three toila screens currently used to screen for certain liver cancer, none is being eliminated, and screening only produces some “less-than-miracle” results, the FDA said Tuesday.\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection said Tuesday that the cases of two livers implanted after loss of bladder cancer “and their result were reported to the agency.” The clinics took part in a test called LimeCopious – a biochip that can detect lesions at 11 micro-molecules by scanning an area for several types of micro-molecules.\nAfter the stem cells were released in May 2015, 52 patients – most of them patients with single malignancies – were tested and the evaluation was successful. It was the first non-cancer clinical trial where patients in multiple tumors were removed and subsequently evaluated.\nThe FDA sent the findings to its deputy director for clinical patient services after the initial positive test of the screen, which was performed last November, for an additional diagnosis of laryngeal cancer. The agency had no comment on Wednesday’s new analysis of the screening.\nIn the pediatric form of the deadly disease, the filth grows into viral ones, and rapidly enters the blood stream when blood is more contaminated than healthy. Patients in the larval form are more susceptible than healthy adults.\nSo far, the FDA has not found any human case of laryngeal cancer arising from that screening.\nThe American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology said late Tuesday it was “deeply concerned that now one of the most sophisticated screening techniques for HPV-related cancers has been used to identify juvenile laryngeal cancer.” The organization previously said the screening program was conducted by the CDC.\nFurther analysis found laryngeal cancer had a “far greater” tendency to develop more rapidly, and that the disease is more likely to occur in younger patients than adults.\nThe ALIAF asked lawmakers to set up a committee to study screening for laryngeal cancer.\n']"
786,Who are the Democratic candidates for president?,"['What happened?\nFirst of all, let’s focus on the Democrats. I think it’s to do with which Democrat at the top? It’s a mind loop. Bernie Sanders was the one to have gotten kicked out of the DNC in 2008 for leaking information of U.S. sanctions against Iran to the Times. And Hillary Clinton doesn’t have much of a middle ground here — but she has now taken control of all of the hottest hot-button issues of the day and basically simply said, “I will be an independent if elected.” These are not votes for tomorrow. They are votes for the 21st century.\nThat brings me to a vote for Democratic presidential candidates.\nThere are also very few bright, unknown opportunities for Democrats. A lot of potential candidates, to their credit, have chosen to run a little farther away from the issues that have defined the Democratic Party so far. The good news is that the current crop of candidates — including Chris Christie, Thomas Perez, Bill Richardson, and Jeff Flake — are all so ambitious, that they have hope for the future. They are every bit as diligent as many of our political candidates in moving forward.\nI know every candidate, every candidate that will be running for president, understands the need for change in Washington, but it seems that even a number of voters who are excited about the slate for the 2020 election, are too distracted to even raise a hand to help face the challenges.\nThey are, in essence, hopelessly out of touch with what happens in the general election. And yet if all of their hopes of playing hardball will be fulfilled, does everyone want their hopes to end?\nSome would say yes.\n“Where’s all this passion, longing for change? What do I tell them?”\nPeople are tired of single-minded congressional payouts, of the infighting that destroys the good-paying jobs and economic security that trickle down from smaller employers to small businesses. And yet the billions of dollars their so-called bipartisanship party is spending to extend the special interests on Wall Street is part of a new socialist agenda that throws harder into opposition than we can imagine.\nSo, yes, I want to give our candidate the opportunity to execute a little bit of this good faith to try to make this country better and give people hope. I want to help get rid of entrenched big-government excesses, but also for a better economy and a better quality of life.\nSome candidates have got it wrong, of course. But that being said, I like Democratic hopefuls. I like all-American, modern, democratic American, or as they call it, a melting pot of “closer” cultures that are just getting started. I like all the people who are going to do their best to fix America if they can. That might be a thousand miles from where I sat in 2008 in the first place.\nIt’s unclear to me what the Democrats are going to make of that.\n']"
787,Coronavirus threatens the November election. Can vote by mail save it?,"['Following President Donald Trump’s surprise announcement Monday that Vice President Mike Pence would soon become the new presidential nominee, various reports suggested that damage to the Nov. 8 election may be worth a visit to the ballot box.\n“It was a sad day,” declared Rudolph Verler, assistant secretary of agriculture for the environment, in a radio interview Monday. “I think it was the largest turnout ever recorded in a presidential campaign. There were about 65,000 more voter signatures than on November 6.”\nWhile only about half of those people in the rural states might have expressed an interest in the election, Verler said that he wasn’t worried about impacts on their minds during the election.\n“Any impact we have going forward is going to be insignificant compared to what’s going to be in 2020,” he explained. “And for them to be awake and able to vote, especially for our natural heritage and agriculture, is going to be a significant thing in the national memory.”\nHistorians at the time attributed the higher numbers to an increased electorate size in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Colorado, Michigan, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and the entire U.S. Midwest. At the time, much of these data was believed to have come from Florida, Ohio, Iowa, Kentucky, Georgia, Michigan, Kentucky, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Missouri, Oklahoma, Nevada, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas and the District of Columbia.\nBut there is evidence that the numbers may be looking up.\nAccording to news reports, 1,093 claims for additional votes have been lodged from the postal system. The number of ballots filed by the Electoral College has been trimmed to allow time for the presidential nominees to be chosen and certified.\nIn Michigan, 89 percent of the notes on final ballot labels have been found to be accurate, while only 7.14 percent of ballots made use of the votes cast by the Electoral College. For Trump to win the presidency, legal experts believe that any problem voters in this election will not have played a role in Tuesday’s results, however.\n“It’s not so much they say their loss will create more fraud or get me ahead,” continued Verler. “If they don’t vote, there’s always fraud after the fact.”\nAnd there’s also evidence to suggest the average voter in this year’s election might have not been unaware of the Electoral College results. According to anti-voter group Free the Vote, the registered voter on the rolls from an unknown state or an alternate state within their ZIP code — some 50,000 new electors in 2017 — reported giving a mail-in ballot a 0.5 percent chance of winning this year’s election.\nA number of states have reduced the number of popular vote winners since Election Day but VSD counts have become increasingly conservative. California had 128,890 registered voters by Election Day. Before then, no state had fewer than one eligible elector.\nBut polling now does offer clues as to the makeup of the electorate — so does the recent uptick in voter “turnout” surveys. On the mail-in ballot — online or in person — 21 percent of registered voters compared to 6 percent in 2016. In the online election, less than 40 percent of voters voted in person versus 40 percent in 2016.\n']"

In any circumstance, I want to raise as many people as possible to work on social justice issues and the improving of our lives.""\nThe Nebraska Democrat also weighed in on the planned 2020 re-election of Trump presidency and the 2020 White House, at an emotional statement also left open, noting that he may run at some point down the road.\n“I’m certainly a man who likes to show that he doesn’t have to prove everything he believes. I like to assert myself and prove how strong I really am. At this point, I have no affiliation whatsoever,” she said.\n“Finally, I want to thank the delegates for their overwhelming support for me during the special primary and together they came up with a plan that was effective, provides a path for me to succeed at all levels of my career and represents what my true potential was until the day I was born.”\n“I am proud of my accomplishments in public service, both state and national, and I remain concerned about the future of our democracy.”\nWhen asked by reporters about her plans for the 2020 run, Gabbard was asked about what would be her top goal.\n“I want to make sure that we do not compromise our values, that we honor our commitments to those that matter most to all Americans,” she answered.\nThe following morning, Gabbard announced her decision to have her organs harvested, saying, “I am very proud of my amazing family and I want to continue to give back to my community as well.”\n']"
789,From 50-year low to fears of 20%? How coronavirus is fast changing U.S. jobless rate,"['In a global world, people come of age. A recent study by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention finds that for a quarter of global health professionals, the peak flu season is underway. Yet, another expert warns that despite global efforts to protect against the influenza virus, an estimated one million lives could be saved this year thanks to this year’s immunisation campaign.\nTwo, “our work against an emerging influenza-like illness has taken a serious step forward,” says study leader: Ziad Abouhossev, a flu and pandemic influenza expert.\nIn the U.S., government funding is set to be slashed this year for flu vaccination programs. Examine how, during the peak flu season, actual flu vaccine stocks have been trending downward, and how healthy a nation might be.\nTo highlight how pro-policies are being embraced, education advocates from UC Berkeley and the Pew Research Center have taken the issue to Congress, and first submitted a bill – the Hill Cleaning Jobs Act – in November to Congress.\nIn the U.S., researchers issued preliminary results of the study. “The responses from lead participants demonstrated that among themselves, there was overwhelming support for a vaccine that would reduce the risk of childhood immunization access for about a quarter of the population who are affected by influenza,” says National Womens Healthcare Alliance executive director Lorraine Petsey.\nOthers gathered resources and prepared a plan for developing the funding plan and publishing the results in December. “They really have come through a very effective kind of funding model,” says Petsey. “It’s not just a three-year-old bill or a billion-dollar bill or a trillion-dollar bill, but something we could use over time.”\nThe President-elect’s office has had its own staff pressure to get the proposal up and running and have written to both governor Sam Brownback (S.C.) and health secretary Jeannie Rhee, calling for an earlier start of flu vaccine production.\nAccording to MIT economist Ryan Perahian, the debate on the US-China trade trade balance may have given rise to the need for a new round of anti-China negotiations – one in which the two countries have a history of trading arms. President-elect Trump has declared that protectionism is a threat to the United States. A new round of talks on a trade deficit will start in May.\n(Photo: Pixabay) A professor at the California Institute of Technology-Los Altos School of Advanced International Studies.\nNot every country agrees with the United States’ stance. In Europe, the U.K. and Australia are faced with the issue of fighting one of the countries most susceptible to influenza. In the U.S., according to Dr. Ellen Fong, WHO assistant epidemiologist, a free-trade agreement could be the measure that could protect against flu. Though much of the world struggles with the flu, she says, “EU countries are few and far between.”\nBut anti-IPA farmers from Switzerland are working to raise public awareness about the deadly virus, as well as those who work to increase access to vaccines and vaccines to prevent this deadly strain from developing.\nPolitical support for the program could help. After all, estimates suggest close to 9 million people are flu-tested in the US, translating into a population-changing “C” level of immunity.\nBut why would people start to turn to it now? For some countries, it’s simply not necessary to start a campaign now. That is why the pope told Filipinos to seek the flu vaccine in their birthplaces.\n']"

(AP) — A Florida Republican who was eager to throw a pro-gun sticker out the window in hopes of testing for septic shock on his car had a nervous breakdown just prior to the crash, according to a report.\nHouse Speaker Richard Corcoran said House Republican Whip Mark Reckless received a lesson from his father on civility Sunday morning. Corcoran said he did not do it with Reckless, but rather with Rep. Erik Rodrigues, D-Miami Beach, who had just taken dinner in the Florida governor’s mansion.\nRodrigues’ father had noted an upcoming medical exam and the teenager didn’t feel well at home. Two dispatchers called in friends, who said they found a virus in an “exit reaction.” Two others, he later confirmed with hospital staff, weren’t hurt.\nRodrigues’ father took the same test to found the virus, which is found in the intestines of malnourished children. He said the child’s mother drank lots of red wine and egg whites.\nCorcoran was at the restaurant, in an area of the Palmetto State near Florida’s capital, when he heard a loud bang and contacted the family. The grandson of Democrat Bob Beauprez was in the crowd, sitting on the patio and climbing over a fence. He said one of the shots shattered his arm and caused bruising to his abdomen.\nCorcoran began laughing about the drills and how upset he was. Rodrigues couldn’t stop laughing about it.\nRodrigues claims he was asleep when the attack happened, but Corcoran said that may be the case, and his sons were all home at the time.\nCorcoran said he was at the restaurant with Todd Goldstein, a member of Corcoran’s Great-Government Action group. Corcoran sent Goldstein a note saying the party was about to begin at the governor’s mansion if he stopped dancing with a group of kids.

793,Pentagon readies San Diego hospital ship and tent hospitals to help with coronavirus,"['United Nations healthcare network the Center for Disease Control is sending a shipment of advanced radiology equipment and solar-powered suits to San Diego next month to assist hospitals with respiratory and pneumonia vaccine programs.\n“This is an incredibly important decision for the United Nations and this facility,” said Center for Disease Control representative Philip Kass. “The equipment will provide advanced fluorescence detection, as well as advanced respiratory surveillance technology, to hospitals.”\nThe $25 million San Diego hospital ship is the first ever from the U.N. organization, which will ship three radiology emergency rooms — full use at the public and private hospitals — to central focus areas in 2019.\nCDR is working with Kaiser Permanente Northern California Health in a variety of tasks. Kass said the Miami hospital ship will tackle fluorescence invapor sensor and “fluorescence-invasivity,” giving health care systems superb care in the mid-Atlantic, including for respiratory mist in patient care.\nA pilot study announced at the CCDC in December said fluorescence invapor would provide an early look at the effectiveness of fluorescence-invasivity, but do not pose a threat to patients with H1N1 flu.\n“The Pilot study shows that fluorescence-invasivity tends to be less successful in breast cancer, lung cancer, blood cancers and other high-risk developing conditions,” Christie Nachman, PDSU president and founder, said in a statement. “Fluorescence-invasivity can reduce the severity of infectious disease symptoms, but that often does not serve as a cure for all.”\nIt is also projected to provide $125 million in fluorescence-invasivity for vaccines and pneumonia in the U.S. over the next five years.\nThe simulation ship is part of the Centre for Disease Control’s Fluorescence Antibody Program, developed in 2013 as part of a project to study how molecular information gathered through fluorescence-invasivity can help with influenza preparedness, patients’ treatment and survival.\nHospitals rely on fluorescence invapor to evaluate they use air monitors, sensor or model objects, augment surveillance systems and their processes. Inventories used to track viruses and other diseases can be increased, and changes in temperature and humidity can increase the threat level.\nThe hospital ship is equipped with a St. Joseph Health CT machine that can track the degree of fluorescence inovapor. International standards require that instruments or simulation equipment to be used in international testing.\nFor the Christmas tranter ship, the UND center planned to share with local hospitals protocols for fluorescence-invapor that would have to be deemed operable and available for laboratory use to comply with international fluorescence standards.\nThe protective covers can be cast in the ocean at sea, so hospitals can install the devices in rooms where cold symptoms are not detected.\nThe delivery of the system, expected by early 2020, will be billed by Kaiser Permanente of the United States. Officials said the hospital will evaluate and test system selection and authorization for U.S. stations.\n']"
794,Coronavirus forces reckoning for Trump’s healthcare cuts,"['NEW YORK (Reuters) - In 2017, Trump’s top appointees, including health secretary Tom Price and National Institutes of Health chief Anthony M. Fauci, announced controversial healthcare cuts to aid cuts to his expensive environmental program.\nWilliam Bennett (C) and Jerry Petroski (R) speak during a ""Morning in America"" interview at the Williamsburg Hotel in Brooklyn, New York May 19, 2016. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\nNow, the continuing imperiled GOP health strategy, with Trump’s other nominees removed, is suffering a sharp reckoning. After the announcement of eight nominees in the late morning on Friday that they have abandoned Obamacare, Trump and health experts are deeply worried about what lies ahead.\nThe most serious concern: that the healthcare cuts Trump was announcing are yet another blow to the president’s mandate, which demands an assessment of program changes and cost overruns, and no one in government can deliver it.\nTrump’s creation of a 39-member National Institutes of Health that mostly pays for the hospital for kids who attend poor hospitals has provoked unease in conservative Republicans over its apparent support for the administration’s vision of expanding Medicaid in poor and wealthier regions of the country.\nFurther entangling the healthcare agreement in government overburdened Medicaid program is the Trump administration’s trying to expand it to make up for waning support in Congress for an expansion. For Republicans, the spending bill supports plans in the next Congress to increase the healthcare cost for a tiny slice of the population.\nYet despite the new conservative outlook, experts say Medicaid funding has fallen flat. They also see major uncertainty in funding for thousands of others in Medicaid, including some states, and calls for early approval of new restrictions on the agency’s budgets.\nBennett’s departure may mean only a small proportion of the U.S. National Institutes of Health employees who were currently covered by Obamacare may quit, most of whom are children under the federal government-funded insurance exchange.\nPrice and Fauci may also cancel their doctor insurance contracts, homecare or out-of-pocket spending, and likely furlough employees.\nA spokeswoman for one of the four governors from Kentucky, which adopted the Obamacare mandate, said the vote in his state was still pending.\nAfter the scheduled confirmation vote on the seven names, Congress must approve, if not begin, a two-year bill to extend Medicaid as well as the plan for cuts to food stamps and other costs for seniors, which President Barack Obama accepted in 2010.\nThe votes will have to be scheduled by Friday evening - when some lower-budget Democrats are likely to reject a Republican version of the health law and keep a clean bill of health. But it is possible the next wave of health officials could be most affected by the future of the long-term care program, because it is crucial to every hospital that is participating in it.\n']"

You are telling me that the ‘right thing to do’ is to put up paying rent in a garbage can, and end up dumping off my past life behind bars. So, we have a constitutional imperative to build a more just and economically viable community.”\nThe administration did not indicate what the timetable might be to investigate the residents who were evicted during the quake, though among the residents were the head of a Brooklyn street-corner homeowners association — David Kuksel, whose development will be one of the largest in Manhattan.\nThis article originally appeared on Newser: Trump Adds Priority to Veto, Spots More Evictions\nMore From Newser\n']"

The new data will boost interest among Government Comptroller of the Currency (CC&C) James McNally.\nThe paper, unveiled Friday, lay out how the government currently accounts for hydrogen gas odors, which are causing legal disputes and hampering the billions of dollars in production capacity from the former’s rise in the U.S. industrial area. The latest report foreshadows problems.\n“If hydrogen gas are used again and incorporated into any new or supplementary pumping, the ability to generate hydrogen will be severely limited,” McNally says in a detailed discussion. “The finite water supply in the United States will eventually become unbearable and we won’t have enough water in the U.S. to survive from what is a food-safety problem.”\nNearly every element in the arsenal of the U.S. industrial system will be shut down in the years ahead, McNally wrote.\n“We’re keeping a pretty close eye on the excess ammonia and kerosene and all the rest of our other industrial tools. And we’re hoping to have the situation covered to the next appropriate level so that we can keep pace with Canadian regulations,” McNally said.\nUnited States Kerosene Balancing Act requests\nMcNally’s report says government plans have been enacted to ensure efficient use of natural gas and other natural gas production to fight the greenhouse gas emissions triggered by shale oil drilling on the Gulf Coast.\nThe report notes that the Obama administration eliminated the law’s requirement for when it approved any new natural gas export terminals and shipped out all existing supertankers. State and local regulators can now turn to federal laws to enforce the law.\nIt also notes that the infrastructure required to retrofit gas pipelines to transport the gas equivalent of 5 million barrels per day from two large plants in Texas to America’s eastern border remained unchanged, even though its demand will continue to grow through 2020.\nThe U.S. could use more liquefied natural gas, also known as LNG, to meet its goal of 9 billion metric tons of transportation capacity for 2020.\n“The US is generating 5 percent of its energy from a non-unstoppable carbon emission sources,” the paper says.\nMcNally highlighted the studies of the first phase of the market-opening process, which he outlined in a “Climate Change 1” report in January. In the panel, Perry Delahay, president of the International Energy Agency, acknowledged that there’s still a lot of room for improvement.\nTo address the gases, the international agency has outlined its action plan, in part, to address the rise in global temperatures by 2030 and air pollution in the 1990s and the decades ahead.\nFor NASA and the National Science Foundation, it’s going to be a 50-year transition from research on space to lunar exploration.\nMcNally also notes that it’s important for NASA and the National Science Foundation to remain on track, and discuss its next steps in the White House space acquisition program.\nIncluded in McNally’s analysis are what he believes are the clues as to the amount of hydrocarbon-rich soil in the U.S. that can be used to create fuels for aircraft, submarines and planes, via fertilizers and chemical products.\n“And these ‘excavations’ are not mutually exclusive,” he wrote in the report. “This is because fertilizers and chemical products contain nitrogen and sulfur in the soil and may have the capacity to decompose in the upper part of a human body.”\n']"

Gavin Newsom has been the face of the state’s groundswell of anti-vaccine activism, speaking out against FDA regulation and embracing a core belief that vaccine-preventable diseases must not be practiced without adequate research.\nBut over the past decade, Newsom has also appointed a permanent appointee to his advisory council and written a bestselling book on the disease. In naming a team of experts to develop vaccines, Newsom has given journalists and parents the tools to voice their alarm against vaccine-preventable diseases. In May, he took aim at a staunchly anti-vaccine, anti-vaccine movement he sees as one of the most destructive forces in the state’s history.\nHe served on the national vaccine advisory council. In 1999, Newsom signed an executive order mandating those who had used vaccines either remain current or to make their vaccines — a process that led to 24 percent of state children receiving flu shots for the first time.

801,Column: Joe Biden could learn from Ronald Reagan,"['Joe Biden\nFranklin Hill\nJoe Biden and his wife, Jill, may be living in the 30s when you consider former Vice President Ronald Reagan is in his 90s and his wife died in 1994. Mr. Biden can’t seem to get along with his wife, his only stop on the America travel tour, or with his press secretary, Josh Earnest, who is responsible for getting him over the head of Donald Trump.\nOn Feb. 26, as The Philadelphia Inquirer’s Jim Kirkwold asked, they seemed to have a good time both in New York City and the suburbs of Baltimore — where Biden was born, and where he played football in New Jersey. (By the way, it’s tough to imagine Mrs. Biden could go all partisan and missing Republican Rep. Donald Graham in the same state.)\nIt turned out that the two may be family. Though Mr. Biden was the first to be named vice president, Mr. Earnest was quickly installed as press secretary, and Mr. Biden arrived in the White House on the day after a political review of possible successors. Naturally, President Trump asked Mr. Earnest to fill that role, but he had the support of Democratic Party officials in both Washington and New York City, and he won the job to the giddy credit of the DCCC leadership.\nMr. Biden won that job in one week, a win likely to improve his standing in the minds of members of the Democratic Party. Though he probably missed the considerable political campaign expenses, his impressive personality and demeanor against the Republicans sure played a huge role.\nThere was plenty of the bad that can be endured during a vice president’s term — what with Congress, the FBI, all — though in 1998, President Clinton was elected to a second term and Mr. Biden received a bipartisan credit for speaking out against the Republican war machine. A Maryland judge found him guilty of “crimes against the integrity of the court,” and in 1996, he was an honorary vice president of our Republic. That was another accomplishment in what would be another eight years of Obama, Bush and now Mr. Trump.\nJoe Biden was a decent man; this just proves the Democratic Party hasn’t had much luck without him. He is so gifted and talented that for his first four years as a senator, in 1992, he won the Democratic nomination for vice president.\nJoe Biden\nBiden, a former senator from Delaware, had spent the previous 17 years traveling from country club to country club, hustling for marriage licenses for politicians, and even fighting around himself to secure a Senate seat in Pennsylvania, where he won praise by his supporters for it. He was often pretty famous in Northeast states; he’s got an indelible photo on his car’s driver’s license, in short, a “Joe Biden.”\nMost of us live a grim life that is easily lived with no there problems. A lot of us experience bouts of depression, depression and depression. But, in this world of crisis, not a lot is left. (From “Vice of Honor” on CNN, Anthony Bourdain, last week, said: “The reason he hasn’t kept his word is because he’s not given credit — it’s because he’s not doing his job.”)\nDuring his vice presidency, Joe Biden was recognized for being the “first” vice president to bring a challenge from Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, then led a newly formed bipartisan “rebuke” PAC, out of the conservative Wisconsin headquarters that Mitt and his congressional allies had set up. It was a week before this relationship with the president came to a final head.\nMr. Biden’s legacy was made bad by the destruction of his career, and that legacy is to this day, in spite of everything President Trump did. I like the words of Joe Biden on the fire that consumed him in 2018 and that effects on millions.\nBut the outlook is dim for Democrats and Democrats across the nation. The president’s other priorities, particularly on immigration, national security and gun control, remain in a bleak state, and his support for impeaching President Trump is not one that could be extended to Mr. Biden.\nJoe Biden is so talented and gifted that for his first four years as a senator, in 1992, he won the Democratic nomination for vice president.\nIt turns out that in spite of everything President Trump did, there hasn’t had much luck without him.\nThat’s right: We do have an old thing: Joe Biden is on the road again.\n*\nNick Engel is a Democrat and historian in Staten Island.

804,5 takeaways from Tuesday’s Democratic primary elections,"['Democratic challenger Shriver called off his appearance on 60 Minutes Tuesday, but doesn’t plan to take questions from the video after that.\nThe campaign for Schenectady County’s 5th Congressional District did not announce plans to unveil his campaign website until last week, but announced Tuesday a local media festival that will bring 50 candidates for Congress to Schenectady.\nChris Barone, Schenectady County Executive; Kevin DeVine, Schenectady City Council; Bill Schmitz, the state’s top agriculture and business regulator; and Harold Chatterjee, Schenectady city manager, will give final advice on how to run for the seat in 2018. Democrats also recognized Nelson and Michael Hastings, the first and second ballots in the race to flip incumbents to Republicans in congressional elections every four years.\nAmong the candidates:\nChris Barone\n• He’s the top candidate, the longest-serving county executive, but asks that any candidate be asked about the details and what their background is.\n• For Senate Democrats, this will be the first two-year hiatus. Republicans only have two-year congresspersons left in Congress. “Basically, I’m just the only one who can turn those names into a lot of money,” he says. The winner of the Senate primary will be the GOP’s choice for the state’s top law enforcement job.\nKevin DeVine\n• He won the Democratic nomination for Albany County Executive. Even though he’s been the county’s fire chief, DeVine says that given his reputation as a fire chief and industry boss, he might not get picked for chief — because he’s gay. He then offers up a few ideas to change the law.\n• He’s talking about how education should be done differently and how his administration would rather get it done than get it wrong.\nMike Schmitz\n• He’s the state’s top agriculture and business regulator, but the Washington state native has been state commissioner for 20 years.\n• His work in the Agriculture Department has come from practicing law as well.\nThe third candidate, Bill Schmitz\n• As the state’s top economic regulator, Schmitz is helping create a strong Minnesota agriculture industry. He also helps build ties with the state’s agricultural energy industry and foreign investors. The New York native’s plans to run for Congress, along with Schmitz’s, are not clear — though he is open to a run. “For me, I want to run. I want to become a good public servant,” he says. “I’ve been on that job for 30 years. It’s become a professional job.”\nKen Levin\n• He is the unofficial chief innovation officer for St. Cloud’s public works, which this race rivals for political influence, much like that of the state Senate race. He’s about as successful in the field as he can be.\nSusan H. Brown\n• She beat out New Brighton attorney Scott Sanford for the school board seat in Lower North Shore, which is expected to close after 2018. She says she’s ready to run again.\n• She made national headlines last year when it was announced that she would not run for Congress and that she hoped the environment would improve.

805,"Trump administration takes steps to close border to migrants, citing coronavirus","['President Donald Trump is set to shut down the U.S. Marshals Service, citing coronavirus levels, according to a report.\nOn Monday, a federal appeals court issued an opinion prohibiting Trump from furthering his sweeping decision to open the U.S. entry marshals’ office to non-residents with visas. The Administration cited potential health risks including a ruptured pheus virus and pyrexia, which can cause heart problems and respiratory illnesses.\nThe administration’s attempt to block the Marshals Service was calculated to be especially sensitive for the people’s health. The decision would require swift enforcement, which is generally not enough, and the first steps under the administration to close the marshals’ office would be administratively and legally challenging, the 28th Circuit Court of Appeals said.\nOfficials said they would immediately close the facilities in response to the decision.\nRepublican Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who faced stiff opposition on the nomination for the post, said in a statement that the executive branch is “on the verge of cutting the birth rate and eliminating over 2 million worker visas over the next eight years.” He would like to implement “renewal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) for Dreamers” and allow law enforcement to hold expedited processing hearings for those brought to the U.S. illegally as children and long-term migrants.\nSeveral aspects of the decision are certain to be appealed, but barring the use of “safe harbor” protections created by former President Barack Obama, the administration said any prosecutions will be conducted on a “case-by-case basis.”\nMany legal experts and government officials were concerned that the government would use the decades-old policy to enforce its immigration policies, and said it seemed unlikely the Obama administration would pursue such enforcement in this case.\nMitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts who served as president during the 2016 election, said in a statement that he has “grave concerns” about the Marshals Service opening the doors to non-residents.\n“While they have the mandate to get all of these people and those that have been brought to this country illegally — from criminality to theft — to return to the community they have always been part of, the administration is not going to reform it,” Romney said.\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the administration had no immediate comment on the rulings.\nMexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, whose country has been flooded with drug drug runners for years and appealed for sanctuary from authorities, said Monday he shares Trump’s concerns, according to The Associated Press.\n“As president, I will always, always, continue to improve relations between Mexico and the United States,” Peña Nieto said.\nA White House official said Friday that the administration would “continue to press our discussions with Mexico on various issues, particularly with regard to refugee cases that have already been confirmed for resettlement.”\nIn the case of long-term migrants who have been brought to the U.S. illegally as children, the government was likely to use an order to close the Marshals Service, the court of appeals found. The appeals court found that the Marshals Service’s executive branches violated the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) Act in working through a regional regional commission to reunite families with their parents.\nAs a result, the Marshals Service requested a U.S. District Court in San Diego, where the court will consider whether the orders violate international law and could be rescinded or left vacant under the Trump administration, the court of appeals said.\nIn one response to the April 4 ruling, the Customs and Border Protection system said Trump’s executive order would unilaterally shut down all ICE detention centers within a week.\nThe proposed National Review review finds that ICE Detention Center, located at the southwest corner of 40th and Vine in east San Diego, has the most exposure to re-entrants. According to the report, ICE Detention Center detainees on a variety of government spending lists have a reported danger of hypothermia as young adults.\nNumerous federal judges ruled against Trump’s April 4 orders to tighten immigration screening, while several judges sided with Trump in his effort to enforce the drug laws on the DREAM Act. But the executive orders and federal appeals courts are different, and some judges sided with ICE in rulings against pending deportation proceedings.\nAnticipating an appeal of the court’s earlier rulings, the administration said it would probably appeal the court’s injunction, and then the reversal.\n']"
806,"‘My phone is blowing up,’ Andrew Yang says as federal officials explore cash payouts to Americans","['WASHINGTON — Phone users in Florida and Mexico will get a fix in the next couple of months, as the Justice Department faces fresh claims that the smartphone industry suffered over an alleged $450 million U.S. scandal over payment policies and services provided to overseas consumers.\nFederal officials, who had been investigating phones and f-b-ing transactions in a number of places, have made public an assessment for those who are home after school, dinner and some other paid for services from telecom companies, the Associated Press has learned.\nThe FBI is also making public similar assessment plans for Americans.\nAnd they have circulated an update for how consumers will respond.\n“This is a major scandal, not just in terms of consumer experiences, but also for the entire telecommunications industry,” said Joseph McCarthy, national security adviser, a former FBI official. “We know that consumers are going to have a very anxious and, sometimes, very difficult time figuring out what is or isn’t going to work. And that’s why they’re going to be critical to knowing what their next move is.”\nMcCarthy insisted that “the focus will stay on financial services companies like AT&T and Verizon and not on telecommunications as a whole.”\nThe FBI assessment is “not comprehensive. We’re calling it factual. We are identifying potentially fraudulent transactions,” McCarthy told The Associated Press. “The government has broad jurisdiction over telecommunications operators and we want to make sure they are being held accountable.”\nNonetheless, he said, the agency is wary of wiretapping cell phone taps.\nWith phone companies not expected to cooperate, a Justice Department official noted, the other side of the coin is terrorism cases in which prosecutors will have to investigate, but remain skeptical that they can do so.\n“Given the size of the issue, we’re not going to be satisfied with some of the estimates and surveys at this point,” the official said.\nAndrew Yang, a spokesman for the Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association, said the company would not comment on the FBI assessment plans.\n“We’re on a leave of absence. They’re going to share their findings with them,” Yang said of his association.\nExperts have warned for months that increased surveillance is an uphill battle in a region where so many Americans fear they are at risk.\nThe FBI, after investigating some 1,700 complaints that AT&T billed its customers for data services such as video calling, had received no complaints, spokesman Andrew Jarecki said. “This is just not an issue for AT&T.”\nThe FBI said the companies’ relationship with ordinary telecom customers is continuing “with minimal, if any, impact to AT&T, although internal communications indicate the companies have continued to provide innovative and efficient solutions to customers’ legitimate concerns and have enhanced the security of their customers.”\nWithout the FBI’s involvement, Sanchez acknowledged the would-be compliance officers will need to investigate two-thirds of those cases, most involving non-core telecom customers.\nThat means that it’s possible that operators will get billions of dollars in services and mobile security should they have been singled out. And that could be a huge boon for the phone companies, which should be able to price their customers out of anything they charge them for.\n“Things I want to see happen for sure,” Sanchez said, “because we haven’t been able to fill the void of data and security for a lot of customers. And it just won’t happen. We have yet to get the front-runner or the top two — these three companies — done at this point.”\nSanchez said that he does not know if federal investigators will also look at AT&T’s ability to make that kind of data and services available to customers.\nBut he added that with T-Mobile among the companies that have asked the FBI for help, that potentially will help investigators “in their investigation on a more realistic level.”\n“That’s the question,” Sanchez said. “It’s not a secret.”\n']"
807,"Checks to Americans will ease the coronavirus slump, but they may not be much of an economic stimulus","[""Q. I am currently pregnant. I cannot conceive until the early due date. I do not know what to do. What should I do? -- JULIEL HARRIS, Everett, WA\nA. Well, you'll hear from you soon. This is an ovarian cancer diagnosis. This is a report card. And there may be some encouraging news, though. How much do you know? Ask your doctor. Often the answer is that the new treatment you're getting is potentially lifesaving, or if it is effective, will prevent many more of the fatal signs of the colon cancer than you could anticipate. In order to keep up to date with the latest information, let us know in the comment section below.\nCancer genes\nSo far, people with cancer genes are less likely to have a tumor like the one detected by the cancer at home. You can say more about your risk:\nThe same group of cancer genes appear to show less predictive capacity than other subjects. Certain predictors (the W8 genes) are turned on at certain times of the day, such as early morning, late evening, or evening, during mating season. The W8 variations have been blamed for large numbers of deaths from genital cancers, ulcers, larynx cancer, and ovarian cancer. The level of CNCIs (fat cells) for males and the level of CNCIs for females with CRC seem to be influenced by the frequency of identifying the CNCIs that are linked to the age of the female. Most cancer samples are associated with a bias towards neutrophil tests that introduce DNA and RNA into the CNCI that are not linked to ovarian cancers. The reaction times to the test are often limited to very short periods, and the months of the month in which all but one of the test sites are already on the day of the predicted passing event. Because we tend to get the 3rd and 4th of the month, the risk of passing the disease is high.\nBut there are also side effects. For instance, some patients, for example, have a higher burden of histamine-linked changes in their nucleus and chaperone tissue. These effects are more likely to be mediated by the gut and the proteins. And when the chaperone delivers care, it may not be successful or extremely difficult for the cancer to develop because the chaperone's role appears to be to make the patient aware of the change in the disease pathway.\nConclusion\nThis study confirms the coherence and the rapidity of modern medical research. You have options and you have a rational choice. But you cannot know which of the seven trials you're getting through this phase of immunotherapy are going to work best. You'll be waiting for a few months to really make any real determinations about whether the drug works or not. If it does, you can watch just one step. You'll ask questions, be ready to do my mouth. But the reality is that despite the seriousness of the disease, you are not going to have the choice to spend a couple of weeks getting evaluated by a small group of medical professionals or continue through this.\nObamacare is at the root of this problem: It's taking us off the path to be the world leader in cancer care, and it's starting to hit the bottle quite hard. That's why we're seeing hospitals turn around and fast-growing employers, franchises, big manufacturers, and, yes, insurers. We're a long way from seeing a cure. On the other hand, we're seeing some pretty good research and much better guidance for businesses -- treatments that produce change-of-pace in fewer genes and more effective drugs.\nIf you or your family wants to change how you see cancer care, how you see your medical history and how you see your treatment outcome, I strongly encourage you to research or start your own on your own. Good luck.\n(Source: Reuters)\n""]"

Democrats would be able to move quickly to retain their control of the House. But they will be left on their own in the absence of two of the party’s major senators from traditional red states. In terms of the overall legislative agenda for the next two years, Democrats rank near the top of Trump’s agenda. The Commerce secretary would face staunch Republican resistance on a variety of top priorities – including boosting infrastructure and combating climate change.\nFeehery goes on to quote Republican strategist Eric Schultz as saying:\nSchultz, who has worked with Republicans on a number of campaigns, said the Trump campaign is hoping to position itself ahead of the midterm elections as a more radical voice for conservatism. “There’s going to be pushback on issues,” Schultz said, “but being a very loud supporter of the president and championing his priorities… sometimes they just may not be there.”\nOuch!\n']"

But if I die, I die’: Florida retirees grapple as coronavirus cases soar","['Florida retiree Sheri Stapleton apparently is not losing her plans when it comes to getting sick, but nurses and medical staff appear to have pulled the plug on her health care plans in an increasingly public — if rocky — episode of Alzheimer’s disease.\nCalls by one nursing home — Torrington — to Stapleton’s nursing home were answered this week only because of pressure on her caregiver to turn off the TV’s audio dial and the sharp daytime television dial. Those calls, however, were not relayed to her employer, Lakewood Public Hospital, and did not come to a call from someone else.\nStapleton had closed her eyes with a sympathetic voice before learning of the call, her older sister and a visiting teacher called her Monday. Her concern of sickness led to an alert to her mother and nurse nurse nurse, who alerted other residents there that the hospital was sending their relatives to travel to the Florida death center.\n“All we were told was that if I died, or had to go there and hear her voice, it’s OK to be here,” Stapleton’s sister, Grace Kohl, told The Associated Press by telephone from “medical” her sibling’s Maine home. “Everyone was distraught. People were not about to get sick.”\nKohl said she and her sister have to commute between the two nursing homes nearly daily to care for her sick sister. She says no one has summoned her to an emergency room.\nBesides being treated at North Point Health and Medical Clinic, Lakewood resident Almaden Ikeda died March 14 and her two grandchildren, Mihalj Chikwa and Savanna Chikwa, also died. Rescuers discovered they had been sickened by a Legionnaires’ disease outbreak in late December, and Chikwa was hospitalized several days later.\nAn infected man was released from a North Point hospital and Chikwa remains in critical condition. A Lakewood nursing home runs a 48-hour facility and requires residents to stay in the facility for at least one week.\nGov. Rick Scott signed a law in January directing offshore facilities to notify residents through their state and federal health departments and health units reporting incidents of Legionnaires’ disease at around 1 p.m. daily.\nAfter an investigation, Lakewood Health Department spokesman Gary Wisto told the AP that he believed a North Point facility waited too long before reporting an incident. Also, he said the Port St. Lucie facility had not had enough consent to send its workers to the North Point facility, a decision that could result in criminal charges.\nLakewood is not releasing names of the person responsible for the incident or their contact information. A source familiar with the matter said the person apparently was connected to a back-up doctor who went to North Point and provided MedStar Cleveland emergency care.\nKohl, 57, of Otterbein said her husband wants her to return to his nursing home. She said she will continue to go to North Point without knowing whether the University of North Florida Medical Center was sending its employees there.\n“My husband got sick and I came home and we were really upset,” she said. “It was very kind of a shock.”\nIn U.S. government-run health care, residents are called when they appear ill to be able to pay bills and give out care. The government considers claims that don’t meet nursing home medical policy all the same as land claims — charges that can raise hundreds of millions of dollars for healthcare. But in the case of illness, the government considers all claims to be deemed “other than clean and primary care” and that no claims are “made against the system.”\nIn North Carolina, which began requiring nurses to notify residents through their state and federal health departments when they’ve been sick, a hospital after an outbreak of the bird-borne Florida disease claimed 83 lives by mid-January. The hospital, Health Presbyterian Hospital, said in a statement that it would hire a unit “to care for patients with central nervous system infections.” It said its staff had gone to the North Point facility after one worker was sick.\nIn the Florida death, there was a local call to Lakewood Public Hospital Monday seeking residents who’d needed medical care. Children, mostly adults with academic problems, were not being admitted, authorities said.\n']"
812,"AIDS crisis shaped Anthony Fauci, disease expert at front lines of coronavirus pandemic","['Anthony Fauci suffered a severe illness for 20 years while working in the field of immunology, but the complexities of the disease led him to believe the highest may have been caused by pandemic influenza. He suspected his virus was from guinea pigs in Gambia and its return to the public domain in late September, a month before a Nepalese lab was irradiated and sickened. He did not know it was another Guinean and had no clue about it - he thought it was a real virus that had been infected in Bong, he says. Although he could not divulge a complete report, like the other researchers he was dealing with, he had personally witnessed disease transmission at the same time from guinea pigs in Gambia.\n""We could have to travel around to all seven provinces. That is how we connected the dots,"" Fauci says, a more than 70-year-old retired doctor. ""I guess that may have foreshadowed what happened to Tony Fauci."" Fauci became one of the first to publicly identify the infectious virus in humans during his ministry role. He hopes to help spread information about guinea pigs infected with the H5N1 influenza virus, while minimizing human contact with people or animals.\nIn the Cambodian capital Phnom Penh, Fauci says that he had attended nine Guinean biotechnology conferences and that he had discovered new viruses. A major concern, he says, is the role of the modern flu in many situations. ""I really, really feared for people,"" he says. ""But we know how to affect big industries.""\nFauci attributes this fear of social impact to the rigidity of the disease that persists at the back of the psyche, he says. He has spent three years working with farmers and other health workers to identify local pandemic flu transmission in well-protected areas. In Haiti, for example, he had meetings with the president of a new sub-region in Haiti and senior officials of regional health authorities. He then went to Gambia and found it could be transmitted to new people by the virus, he says. To allow him to discover more specifically the virus and to help preserve the human population, Fauci chose a shared reservoir on the mountains in the far-off Gambia. ""We want to open it up, to also kill the mosquito that will carry Ebola,"" he says.\nFor Fauci, protecting the public is the first thing that comes to mind when you think of pandemic flu. It is also a recurring concern. ""It is one of the major factors that causes a pandemic. It has become more pronounced in recent years. Not only do we think this is a global phenomenon - it seems to be spreading rapidly - but also it has been correlated with other pandemic causes. If you look at the flu virus that\'s currently circulating in the West, it\'s actually very effective and expanding its influence among people.\nBy the time it comes to us, some people are even going to end up being infected. So that may lead to research into the protection of our own population and our own population,"" he says.\nDuring the last ten years, a small group of scientists and journalists has emerged to work with the disease while a lot of traditional scientists have been involved. It was initially believed that Guinean guinea pigs and other infected animals could pass on the virus to humans and then it developed into a super-virus. But that model is not capable of replicating in chimpanzees, he says.\nAs director of the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, he is a defender of the scientific mission of the United Nations and the UN\'s HIV program. ""No one who has received information on whether a pandemic flu has arrived has any idea how rapidly, if at all, it\'s already out there,"" he says.\nDespite their involvement, his laboratory colleagues never knew it was a virus. So after 9/11, they rushed the virus. In 2004, Fauci discovered that the virus had arrived in the camps that were mined. On the second anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, he was gravely ill. Even then, he thought maybe the human data had begun to contain some information about the disease.\nThough most health officials viewed the suspected virus as a potential form of pandemic influenza, Fauci believes its behavior was suspicious. His colleague at the center of Guinean research has found that the virus came to his clinic on the same day the backpack of his personal journal was irradiated and poisoned. ""This is a terrible development and an unfortunate timing,"" he says.\n']"

Speaking to reporters at his office, Trump said, “It’s terrible, terrible.”\nHe added that the security of the United States and Mexico was “bigger than ever” and that the “unstable and ultimately difficult situation” was “being intensified” by the arrival of the Invasive Pathogenic Horn virus.\nThe outbreak of the H3N2 virus, which is becoming more contagious, is affecting millions of people in the United States and Mexico, and there are growing concerns about global health, particularly among migrants from Latin America and the Caribbean. It is believed to be a copy of the H3N2 virus.\nTrump said he spoke with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto by phone on Sunday, and that Trump said “we’ll be changing everything that we have as he tells us he wants, and as the president tells us he wants.”\nDuring an encounter with the president at his Monterrey ranch, Trump said, “That’s not a serious thing for me. That’s not the thing I’m worrying about.” He said Trump asked Pena Nieto to behave like the head of an independent state, and that the two leaders agreed to discuss “how we can make it more safe for the country.”\nSpeaking directly to Trump and Sen. Johnny Isakson, the Republican who heads the office of National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster, the president said, “Mexico is not part of this effort.”\nTrump has made threatening travel restrictions a priority in his presidency.\n“Right now I’m calling Mexican President Pena Nieto to tell him that we are doubling down on these threats, and they should get down to the mental health of our very strong people,” Trump said. “They should meet with me to tell him we are doubling down on these issues with not only Mexico but the entire hemisphere.”\nTrump said he was seriously considering a change in America’s policies to include more immigrants and to involve more business in the Mexican economy.\nTrump said that he is considering adding a guest worker program if he is the GOP candidate in November, but noted that the wage increase will have a “very neutral impact on the economy.”\nThe new Mexican president said that he is a pragmatist with the support of both parties, and that is typical of a Trump presidency.\nHowever, he also said he was highly sensitive to the issue of migration and noted that he will rely on the State Department to keep a close eye on migrants and drug gangs on the Mexican border.\nTrump told reporters that he wants to take steps to facilitate the export of hard drugs to Mexico.\n“We’re looking at 300,000 of them with the drive of Mexico,” he said. “We are sending 4 million guns and so forth to Mexico.

On Navajo Nation, coronavirus creates worry and confusion as cases surge","['COLUMBUS, Ohio (WCMH) — Amid a growing health crisis on the Navajo Nation, calls are coming from people on the waiting list for drinking water that comes from higher-cost utilities.\nLocal health officials say people need to check on elderly survivors for possible illnesses. But, the Otovale District health official says, when kids are sick, the medical system will save the children, and cure the people who aren’t sick.\nLike thousands of other people on the waiting list, before the Sioux Tribe is one step closer to an expanded drinking water supply on Navajo Nation land, camp and water service has been in danger.\nThe rest of the national water system is choked with gas and has limited access to drinking water. The problem is especially acute on Navajo land where American Indians have lived since the early 1800s.\nNavajo Nation members are in constant fight to protect the water, especially during this past month, when dozens of well water systems were shut down due to the contamination.\nAnd while the problem on Navajo Nation was due to anti-Navajo sentiment, epidemics of respiratory infections, especially flu, remain, says Jack Sands, an Otovale medical official. The people are also in danger of death from an illness linked to influenza, the man-made environmental threat facing Navajo Nation.\n“If my virus is now in my face, I want to take it. I want to be able to think about what the next six months are going to be like,” says the man-made environmental threat facing the rest of the national water system.\nAccording to the State’s Health Department, coronavirus, which carries the virus, is already in Navajo Nation water supply, along with 8 other issues. And with approximately 200 miles of exposed coastline are now closed, it’s no wonder the health system wasn’t able to bring in enough samples.\nIn response, Rescare International, and a public awareness campaign aimed at discouraging the mosquito carrying infectious diseases.\n“They’re at our edge. They’re part of us. And we have a responsibility to make sure that they’re not able to infect us at the site of the contamination, and not contaminate us,” says Sands.\nThe Navajo Nation relies on local drinking water and power plants to power the supplies that do, too.\nThe only way, for the health system to maintain normal drinking water and treatments, is to get the Navajo Rehabilitation Authority (RRA) to put it back on stream by 2020, Sands says. If needed, a maintenance project is made to make water connections to the rest of the national water system in the region, which would limit the spread of the virus and lessen the impact of weather.\nAccording to the RRA, drinking water is flowing from land contaminated with sediment and groundwater. Last month, the Navajo reservation dealt with a letter sent home from the Governor of the Navajo Nation warning everyone not to drink the water because it could cause serious health issues.\n']"

However, critics argued that the bill added actual human rights and that the policy could further “unduly burdens” employers.\nEliot Feinstein, co-founder of the birth control lobby Common Sense Media, echoed those concerns.\n“Agency policy would make people ineligible for deliveries under their current state-approved policies and would impose perverse incentives on private companies,” Feinstein told the Journal.\nProgressive President Gloria Steinem had echoed the criticism of the new policy, saying it would likely lead to unsafe labor conditions for women.\n“What I’m afraid of is that our politicians are going to change the law after this and if women are going to be able to provide birth control, they’re going to have to face it in other ways,” Steinem told NY Daily News.\n“We’re not going to be able to help pregnancies survive, but we can help them to survive if they can take care of themselves.”\nNeither Golden Gate University nor the clinic have announced any plans to expand their obstetric services in New York.\n']"

820,News Analysis: The new U.S. hope for replacing the president of Venezuela: Coronavirus,"['Oct 15 (Reuters) - A stunning but paradoxical event occurred to showcase a U.S. shift towards staying out of Latin America and seeding broader transatlantic alliances that are all but impossible in a rapidly ageing America. The trend is likely to carry on, at least initially, while improved governance and other mechanisms are bound to emerge as a shared inspiration and catalyst for action.\nThe reality is the supposed conventional wisdom is simply wrong. The 1990s U.S. policies have proved futile, the rise of an increasingly authoritarian, neoliberal and economically divided world, one that emerged over 50 years later after energy, trade and other obstacles shouldered.\nThe United States is finally moving in the right direction in its relationship with Latin America, making a big and stunning shift to a more inclusive and open society, defined as a place where countries on an equal footing can do well economically and do the right thing for the common good, while keeping in mind the demographic reality and continuing to look for levers for stable peace.\nYet, how do you move with the level of self-imposed sanctions and meddling in a tightly run country such as Venezuela for most of the last 50 years? The change does not look much like Republican Alan Grayson’s far right vote they once wore on elections, and it’s hard to see a definitive movement on either side trying to pull this off.\nUnfortunately for Democrats in Congress, they almost assuredly will avoid lifting these kinds of measures for a whole of their near term here. But, there could be a road back in time for what would have been a very progressive Democratic Congress by 2150, and that would include Democratic interventions on either side of the aisle, in the Middle East, India and elsewhere.\nGiven the concentration of power in Washington to the far right Republicans, there is actually little room for intervention by the White House on Venezuela, which has become a mirror image of the U.S. debacle. Yet, existing pressure, knowledge and diplomatic co-operation from successive governments to avoid further destabilizing incidents with president Hugo Chavez may just signal time in the long run.\nThe Venezuelan leadership is not yet backing down in attempts to keep it in power. Chavez recently urged his people to continue with their dreams and to focus on their basic values of equality and national identity as much as on destroying capitalism.\nThe President of Colombia made a point to stand and fight during an incongruent but not unprecedented time of tension, including in the Caribbean and the U.S. between 1930s and 1933, although the approach to Venezuela reflects a much different logic. Yet, Caracas has rallied all those many decades ago, sometimes for its own sake and sometimes for its own survival.\nThere is absolutely no justification for moving with more sophistication, competence and diplomacy as part of the new order, in which a dead-end world has been brought upon itself.\nFar from allowing the politics of an oligarchy to advance as long as it has, now with enough power is the left’s chance.\nIt is right of the left to contest for economic and social change, and even as president of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, Caracas, could set the country on course for a change if it continues to exercise control in the current economic crisis that includes a whole spectrum of state monopolies, monopolies of working class workers’ and student and cultural groups’ interests, and the social cost of undermining business autonomy.\nTo accomplish the ends that a president of Venezuela and a left led government could help, The U.S. should continue to allow the most benign agents of self-determination such as those in Venezuela to control their own economies, while simultaneously creating a more balanced economy by producing productive entrepreneurs and miners, low-carbon, upward mobility for many undernourished people and respect for the rights of workers, in an approach that is likely to be popular in Latin America, where the Venezuelan presidency is in place.\nIt is the indispensable role of the Left in the hemisphere to insist that governments act in accordance with the will of the people, so that the interests of the majority of countries should not be deprived of their independence. In the context of today’s Venezuela, the leftist left has achieved an even harder goal.\nNordic interests may also be trying to avoid capitulating in their own internal war on freedom. Latin America is not easily retaken or sold off, and a failed Venezuelan presidency could be that win, and Mexico may wish to give up on its efforts to put the U.S. behind it when it is sufficiently brittle.\n(This post was originally published on Reuters.com)\nPlease help us: View the chart from MSA, find a way to help us understand a key question at Newzbin2.org and try to get complete information on immigration, banking and foreign policy.)\n']"

824,Isolation is hazardous to your health. The term ‘social distancing’ doesn’t help,"['When parents have a hunch about how people are going to behave around them, how is it understood? How is it understood when you ‘can’t put your thumb on your trousers’?\nThe social distancing function of negative thinking is not given enough space and there are too many pictures of members of various groups doing bad things and throwing objects to harass them.\nWe need a bigger picture. The study authors of the Oireachtas report entitled the Careing Results of Kids Are Obsessed with Sensitive Mentally Distancing Children; write that it is our duty to help people in similar situations. The only way to do that is to offer peer support and mutual advice to people in similar situations.\nThese two words are ‘social distancing’ and, like others, we are unable to secure this place from the poorer person.\nIf we were to teach real social challenges, we would show how to get people around their groups even after the stress has already been caused.\nIndeed, changes in behaviour and life experience will give everyone who is social distancing the opportunity to give more, who might not just be socially distancing himself.\nWhat kind of psychological challenges can we create from a group comprising regular noise and shouting?\nIt is important to recognise that we can control emotions.\nThe people who have been photographed making fun of their group are less likely to alter their behaviour and its consequences. And, as with a party people are less likely to do they become more socially distanced.\nOverall, social distancing is part of us.\nPart of the challenge is that we need to make it work very well.\nAnd it can be done very cheaply.\nThe model includes psychological treatment and self-help. Through training and research, we have been able to develop a number of theories of how these techniques will help the unruly group to behave.\nOur experiments revealed that social distancing is the best way to deal with contagion effects.\nConfusion and trauma are an emerging form of psychology in which human beings perceive these events as being unjust or embarrassing. It is also thought that these attitudes can be replaced by behavioural reassurance and trust that we can cope with their adverse effect on us.\nIn science fiction, for example, trickery is as common as pranks. In this case, turning attention into a familiar annoyance gives someone some power over the person. But when you’re the aggressor, it’s hard to overcome this phenomenon by finishing you off in rude behaviour.\nWhen we let people have time to function and be around others, we are able to use the shock as a fuel to create discomfort.\nInstead of repeating the same rules, we can strengthen them, including initiatives that involve us activating just one fear of social distancing — a reaction to person limits or at least ones not conducive to doing something disruptive.\nSomething works.\nResearch now shows that social distancing means that nothing more than avoiding a loud fight or going to the trouble of getting beat up. The idea is to resist such situations altogether. It is learning to recognise that no one else could do it.\nTogether, our research and our study, we are building upon real research by checking how people react to noise and people for clues as to when they are going to be disturbed by it. The new model, once it’s further modified, is helping to define how well people manage this important part of social distancing.\nIf we want to build resilience in our times, we need to understand more.

825,Joe Biden calls for a national lockdown to contain the coronavirus,"['Vice President Joe Biden on Sunday called for a national lockdown to contain the coronavirus that sickened more than a dozen young men and women, and reports surfaced last week that one of the victims has died.\nThe World Health Organization, which frequently evaluates emergency preparedness plans, said last week that the cause of the outbreak that infected 29 young men and women in New York City was a seasonal illness called coronavirus sepsis. It is extremely rare and since the outbreak was first reported in the southern city, experts said the numbers are likely going up as more cases are reported in the city.\nTwo sources told The Associated Press that the disease was so rare that more than 100 babies were infected, nearly all of them infants, from the northern Connecticut community of Bangor. Schoolchildren were attending classes in the town of 1,600 people.\n“It is way worse than first thought,” said Jane Redford, a spokeswoman for the Middlesex County Public Health Department. “We can’t rely on any kind of immediate threat like that right now. It’s beyond worst-case scenario.”\nSpokesmen for President Donald Trump and Democratic Gov. Dannel Malloy both told the AP last week that they were focused on keeping Boston in lockdown because of the possibility that sepsis was spreading to other homes and children in the area.\nThe administration denied ever saying a child of Boston would be infected. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio called attention to the possibility of the outbreak in a statement Sunday.\n“This is about opportunities for children,” the mayor said. “We don’t believe a child would be infected by sepsis as we have seen in other infectious diseases like influenza.”\nThe health department has a statewide watch list of teachers and other officials who would be especially concerned if young children were infected, Redford said.\nEven with the current risk, the hospital in Bangor said its workers sent off a “sea of droplets” that bubbled up through the air in three hours of breathing and died within about 40 minutes.\nIt was the first time all health officials from around the globe have received threats in the 24 hours since the outbreak began, White House spokesman Raj Shah told reporters on a conference call on Sunday. The president has vowed that with national elections in May, he will back whichever political party comes out on top.\n“The reality is it is a situation we have the potential to solve, but it is a level of tragedy where we have these potentially contagious illnesses that are very difficult to monitor,” Shah said.\nMelissa Fuscaldo, a nurse and the director of the hospitals in Bangor, said that after people started fearing more cases of the disease, doctors learned of children in lockdown.\n“From my perspective, they were the ones who were fearful of something that is going to happen,” she said.\nAlthough Massachusetts has among the country’s highest rates of sepsis, it does not have the same number of deaths from a deadly outbreak of the disease that struck the United States in 1997, said Rosemary Morriff, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nNew York City officials called the last deadly outbreak of sepsis in 1996 “the worst measles outbreak ever,” but said other cases were linked to a rise in West Nile virus in 1999 and early 2000.\nWhile the virus is less common in the United States than other nations such as India and Australia, it still comes into contact with people almost everywhere and has weak control from lead poisoning, Corveys and other household air pollution, said Caroline Burt, research and management professor at New York University’s School of Public Health.\n“They just don’t have the controls,” Burt said.\nShe said that if the outbreak goes beyond a single city, there could be numerous more outbreaks because of the complexity and proximity of the virus.\nSome experts said that right now the cause of the outbreak is not clear. Nor are there enough samples for testing to make a definitive diagnosis, the CDC said. It has also found illnesses from sepsis in the United States from children to newborns.\n']"

But to hear Fred Singer, chief investment officer at State Pacific Financial Corp., speak, they’re reluctant to do so.\nThe financial meltdown that followed the 2008 financial crisis, amid financial manipulation and collusion between Wall Street and industry, was brutal. Cash funds like State Pacific, State Street and New York City pension funds had their assets drained into virtually worthless financial instruments, and the three public pension funds responsible for them were plunged into the depths of misery in 2008.\nEvaluating the range of options available for donors, officials at both state and local government agencies sounded optimistic that the state pension funds could come up with some of the money needed to do what it would most likely do if it were shut down and FEMA was taken over by their own cahoots.\n“We have the second-highest state pension fund in the country. We have $1 billion in state pension,” said Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee, about whose home state was the site of the 2008 crisis.\nBut now, after some more signs of recovery, those prospects may be dim. The Federal Emergency Management Agency ended its third quarter fiscal year on Jan. 31, and while it could use some of the $25 billion for some operations, it doesn’t seem likely to do so in the near future.\n“We would like to see FEMA utilized for all purposes. We are weighing possible options,” acknowledged Kurt McHale, acting commissioner of the FEMA Office of Management and Budget, to Politico.\nUntil then, state and local officials in the nation’s third-largest state, Rhode Island, are hoping for the best.\n“We just want the best outcome possible for the people of Rhode Island. And we want to get as much coverage as we can,” said state Superintendent of Public Schools Susan Towell, adding that she was expecting a “fair amount of funding.”\nSo we can hope for the best. Even now, however, she warned, it would take a steady steady hand to solve Rhode Island’s problem.\n“If you delay catastrophe for an extended period of time, it is difficult to access funding. And if the situation deteriorates, you have to wait, or worse, for FEMA to come back and tell you how much it will pay you to come back,” Towell said.\nFEMA has a list of things it wants to see happen with the program, but nowhere near the resources necessary to fulfill their supposed mandate.\nPentagon spokesman Drew Hammill said it’s now up to Congress to determine if some money is needed.\nIf the Legislature can’t muster the support of enough Republican support to clear that hurdle, sources told The Post, lawmakers are considering a strong special session to avert the SDEF shutdown. “There’s some funding lapses that could impact our ability to reopen the Department of Social Services,” said Rep. Ann Marie Buerkle, a Republican from Beverly Hills, referring to the department. “We are hoping to be able to begin full reopenings in July. But for now, as the regular nature of the regular operations begins, it can be very difficult.”\nLast month, the Budget Committee voted to extend for a year the SDEF closure deadline. SDEF’s dissolution would mean that the budget agency would need to close in the fall to stay open. As has happened elsewhere in recent years, the changes will vary with the result of what the legislature decides to do.\nSen. John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat, has offered some possible changes to help preserve SDEF because he has not yet identified one. But he said the money is not there for that.\nIf money is not there, the SDEF will need to “pursue an involuntary option of having the State Department budget in hand” over the fall, Kerry said.\n“It’s completely inappropriate for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to end its mission. That means that anything that can lead to that decision is useless to the state of Rhode Island.”\n']"

These are actions and clauses where SCs have been in power for a long time and need a consultative mandate from the Prime Minister for formulation of the implementation of these changes.\nTherefore, there is a need to first learn how the SE structure works. Since it will be the process of introducing new CRs in place, it must be put on a fast track. This is where the origin and methods of originating the model for a new SE scheme are learnt.\nThe creation of these SEs and place of a Special Administrative Region (SE) will help create a model of what these SEs would need to do in order to be considered for different instruments in the future.

Most of the commentary is familiar to Jews: the tragic tale of the natural dead, the Torah, the popular ideas that will surely capture the minds of a mass of followers. (Biblioteca De Relioso Morais Jurriósa Nacais Jejapanti)\nAnd the danger that comes with it, more or less. The Zika virus hit Argentina in January 2015 in one of the largest outbreaks of the virus in world history, with some 23,000 cases on record. The virus has since begun its lethal descent in the United States. (How many of us know? I’ll leave it to scholars to figure out the true numbers.)\nThe JCCI commentary comes at a particularly late time, as the committee reviewing the content of the JCCI summer symposium is currently finishing its books. But, if anything, the danger is always on the rise, no matter how proactive or not. Like many letters, the members of Joplin’s Zimbra paused to think when they got sick for the first time. Later they worried that the new pandemic could lead to more infections or death as a result of more mosquitoes.\nIn the intervening months, Joplin has been eking out a victory.

837,Women in New York giving birth alone may be facing their ‘worst nightmare’,"['NEW YORK (AP) — It might not be with you at New York City’s Bronx Zoo, but a new study suggests women who have struggled with going to hospital due to any side effects for pregnancy or labour may have the worst cases of childbirth.\nCynthia Kworkias, a psychologist at the Bronx Zoo in the Bronx, says she has been working with researchers to put it further into context by asking pregnant women whether they experienced pregnancy complications when they were taken to hospital for emergency care, or if they had not been seen after delivery.\nShe says the results show that women whose previous experience with delivery were much more severe than the ones who went home should have a better understanding of the severity of risks that an emergency can have.\nIn a study, Kworkias and colleagues analyzed data from 372 women who had been taken to a Bronx clinic to have an emergency vaginal delivery and who had had traditional, sometimes severe complications such as birth failure. Some of the women had refused to go home for delivery.\nThey found that women who returned home the first time following their acute birth problems had lower survival rates than women who hadn’t had unprotected vaginal delivery.\nWhen Kworkias and her team compared 13 years of births by women who had been absent for five years or more as a consequence of childbirth with vaginal deliveries, the rate of newborns receiving emergency delivery was lower than had been seen with birthnumbers, but still lower than those who had not been treated.\nCompared with women who were not hospitalized, for example, they had lower rates of hospitalization for childbirth and subsequent maternal morbidity and mortality, and a lower rate of mortality in childbirth than women who didn’t have vaginal delivery.\nKworkias says that raising young girls and assuring them that they would be safe during pregnancy can make it difficult for women to properly use birth centers.\n“A lot of parents when they are expecting are very nervous,” she said. “They don’t want to give up expecting to get a baby safe, of course.”\nKworkias believes the study to learn more about the experience of moms in New York by predicting if women who underwent emergency vaginal deliveries would have as a result received those care guidelines more readily.\nSo far, she’s seen few surprises.\n“What we are seeing in the Bronx is encouraging for people who’ve had much more prolonged delays in services because of deliveries, and what we are seeing is that there is hope for those women. There’s hope that the delivery will be faster,” Kworkias said.\nStill, Kworkias says, “Every woman should take heed from your experiences. The thing that’s not what matters for an EMT is your experience.”\nIt’s not just the survival rate of women who’ve experienced emergency childbirth, or for those who haven’t. The team also found that the rate of pain and infections that medical providers deal with in childbirth are much lower in women who have had emergency vaginal delivery, but they are most often included in hospital cases.\nAnother explanation is that women who had four-month-old babies died when they were delivered and their deaths were nearly double the rate of those who’ve had six-month-old infants, who die when they were delivered with only a baby inside, according to the report.\nThe study does not measure postpartum patient care because it wasn’t done in a vacuum, but the precise extent of that gap. The study wasn’t done in an artificially created box of babies, as the zip code it follows received a relatively weak summary score for access, Kworkias said.\n']"

What will special interests get?","['The mammoth billion-dollar Deficit Reduction Act of 2009, which was approved by the House on March 22, generates a combined $2.4 trillion in savings over four years. The legislation would create a tax deduction for tax payments as well as budget-deficit reduction programs through sequestration.\nHowever, the bill hasn’t been up and running for a week because of rounding errors. That’s a problem, of course, but I can’t stress how exasperating it would be if Congress were cut in half for a month.\nSo now you can:\n• Enact programs using an average of $2,200 per recipient every year for at least four years until the due date.\n• Act to allow up to two consecutive payments per recipient for Medicare.\n• Enact the China Truce Charge tax credit (JCT) for five years.\n• Enact the Natural Resources Jobs Tax Credit for the first year in a row until they’re suspended in 2022 for one year in the second year.\n• Start the Small Business Jobs Act, though it doesn’t specify any groups until 2020.\nThe fact that these programs are not obvious from the constituent parts of the bill indicates they are hurtful and unimportant. No wonder those who just “won” on the back end of the deal would be pining for a measly $1,200 per recipient per year. Yes, consider that the cost of the stimulus bill totals out to $1.2 trillion. This is on top of Obama’s nearly half a trillion-dollar deficit.\nEven if the government had solved this problem in a short period of time, the benefits of the stimulus to the economy would be greatly diluted. That’s why we get tax reductions on the top of the tax cut, plus some tax relief on energy bills and auto sales that wouldn’t have happened if Congress had listened to the industry.\nFor example, if House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) were to sign this bill and offset a record number of dead Republican homebuyers by supporting a subsidy for electric cars, he would be pushing Congress into implementing the Waxman-Markey Energy and Natural Resources Act, which would encourage cleaner and more efficient vehicles. However, over the next four years, a Democrat-controlled Senate would strip those subsidies entirely and pass on this massive tax gain to the industry.\nWhat this is about, of course, is that the current system provides less or no economic benefits to the average homeowner through the implementation of the $2,200 tax deduction for payment after five years, even though we already have millions of subsidized homeowners who are experiencing soaring energy bills because their energy bills are doubling every year.\nThe primary reason for this is because average homeowners aren’t living in the greatest nation on Earth. In fact, the top 1 percent incomes are barely above the national average. So it helps to give tax incentives to certain industries and to satisfy the politically correct privilege of the wealthiest Americans. Obama’s signature programs during his presidency cost $2 trillion in tax relief over four years. For every $1,000 in tax breaks for millionaires, everyone makes $4,000 more.\nSo while the “go big or go home” principle is greatly overused, if you are a homeowner trying to make ends meet, it shouldn’t be a big deal. Should we take that on, to change the tax laws? Or just give federal funding to the housing market that it had used for 10 years?\nOh, let’s forget the big deal. As George Ishi, former executive director of Congress’ Independent Spending Commission, once told me, “If there is no provision for relief for anyone, no additional money is placed on us to pursue that condition of relief.” In other words, if you save enough money and you’re an ordinary homeowner who’s paying taxes, why don’t you step forward and say, “I could make an impact on the economy this year”? When I live in a city like Los Angeles, I can’t imagine any hardship that might befall someone who’s paying for rent but isn’t getting the money.\nOkay, back to the big deal. If you were walking away and could not take a close look at the numbers because a few things changed, then it would be foolish to take a chance by weakening the president’s veto of the stimulus bill. In the long run, this massive tax law is likely to increase deficit spending for the next year. We’ll just have to watch the tax increases and spending cuts that will get passed, and see whether we can fund it at all.\n']"
840,"For many in India, the biggest concern isn’t coronavirus. It’s hunger","['There are only 27 reported dengue cases in India in 2020, yet of the nearly 7.2 million cases, 11,000 in India died from the rare disease, compared to a predicted loss of more than 3 million in 2013. Before embarrasing our worst-ever yearly rate of dengue in India, check out the country’s isolation. These were reported over May and September last year; since then we have only followed up. Even those diagnosed are two weeks early, often. South Asia has has much smaller dengue outbreaks, as it reported more than 21,000 cases in 2015.\nNow, for the first time since South Asia’s humanitarian crisis at the start of the 1990s, we can produce figures, provided conditions allow.\nThe landmark Dengue Division Watch Report shows that bilateral dengue pandemics killed 100,000 people last year. It’s a massive phenomenon. Prior to dengue pandemics, there had been only 37 such cases between 2001 and 2003. At the time of the Guwahati Ebola pandemic in 2002, it killed 2,000 people and caused an estimated 10 million tons of illnesses. World Health Organization has said that 15 countries throughout the world could be affected by this rare disease:\n“If the Chinese will enable, let’s be clear what the cost might be,” Swireen Ears, a WHO/Ravi Steyr trained microbiologist who led the Dengue Commission, told The Indian Express. If our global trend has been that deaths from dengue are declining, now’s the time to turn to solutions to the dying pandemics. According to the 2015 Influenza Dethfighting Study, no more than 1.5 percent of the total casu\xadlets worldwide have died from the disease in two years — and that number has gone up to 10 percent in just two years.\nHow can you call for a reduction in the amount of pandemics that have occurred?\nA significant factor is population: We have exceeded that of India in the number of migrants in the last decade. There are 68 million people in the world; it is the most fertile land in the world. Whether you call it famine or better said turfic water, 80 million people in the world die every year from dengue, which means that in the last quarter of 20, 2022, more than 38 million people are going hungry — one of the highest numbers of unindulged disabled persons in the world.\nIs the pandemic on the mind of Indian security forces?\n“India has our DNA in the migration of people,” Ears said. “The exposure of the local and international community is a major reason for our ability to control infection rates.” When the outbreak is caught early, Dichotomy is done, using the method of acute dengue infection, in which the virus is divided in two groups: a nevirus, usually found in the subcontinent, while a virus developed in Southern Asia, except Africa, becomes passed on by the immune system.\nThough the focus in the field of dengue management is “molecular medicine”, there are other diseases that can trigger dengue pandemics like influenza, mad cow disease, hog virus and dengue virus, making this disease far less global.\nOnce dengue becomes a global problem, experts say it could cut both the uptake of pandemics in the world, and the number of victims. In the 1990s, 5 million people died from dengue. Since then, some 2.5 million have died from the disease.\nHow do we curtail it?\nThe world has a number of crises — natural disasters, climate change and global economic downturns — and one of them can be blamed on the pandemic. The worst in these crises are the three big agricultural crises in our lifetime: dengue eradication and desalination. “The dearth of vaccine has led to a long and challenging monsoon,” The Indian Meteorological Department explained in 2016. “However, after a monsoon, the monsoon interacts with dengue, also reducing dengue mortality in the rural areas and other sub-divisions, especially in parts of the rural areas. By monsoon, there can be significant removal of the dengue but also decreasing in occurrence, due to dry areas and high temperatures.”\n']"

In some cases, it can cause kidney stones. And often when you infected people, if they knew that you were a test leviathan or had some poor immune system that was at risk, they would not get tested.\n“Finally, the patient infection isn’t quite as isolated as first thought. We are working through hundreds of possible other ways of preventing the spread of the disease, but we know this could be very expensive.”\nHe added: “While we don’t know how many pregnant women are dying of the virus, we know it is so dangerous that we have to try more than just measures to stop people infecting their babies and ensure the patient remains healthy.\n“If there’s one thing we know from anecdotal evidence, it’s that people living in certain areas of England can become infected with the virus, even if they are not ‘mature’.”\nAn outbreak of coronavirus in October 2013 sickened 16-year-old Ashley MacQuarrie, a teacher in Leeds. She was sent home from university but died a few weeks later.\nTwo months later a similar case caused severe respiratory illness and kidney failure. But despite recurrent infection, she died in 2011, two years after the official coronavirus was discovered.\nA further nine cases were reported in February this year, seven in patients with coronavirus, and five more who died in recent months.\nThere are more than 16,000 cases of coronavirus in Britain in 2018.\n']"

REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch/Files\nTens of thousands of sex workers are paid at government-run state service centers since 2012, according to a survey of sex workers in the country by the leading sex workers’ union, ACTRESS.\nWith immigration controls on the rise - including a doubling of permits for migrants this year - there has been growing concern that sex workers are being exploited in the high-wage German market.\nSome reports have suggested that any laws requiring sex workers to show up for work have been overly restrictive.\nLast year, two arbitrators noted that “Germans have different demands for sex work”, and that perhaps limits should be added to the official minimum wage - $6.50 per hour.\nAccording to ACTRESS’s 18-page report on the situation, many sex workers have been restricted in access to places to sell sex. A total of 80 percent of guests would not be allowed to rent the services of prostitutes or traditional interviewers, it said.\nThis was accompanied by reports that 50 percent of the sex workers renting this part of the country had been denied access to local prostitutes or facilitated prostitution, in violation of which they were forced to become part of the sex trade.\nCAMPAIGN PROMISES\nAn online petition by ACTRESS calls on the government to create special laws to prevent sex workers from being able to participate in work, and also ask lawmakers to hold hearings into sex workers’ health and well-being.\nThano said that the decision to tighten rules was based on how well sex workers feel about sex work. However, she added that local staff members should not be marginalized.\n“Tens of thousands of sex workers are feeling certain that laws have not kept up with regulations on prostitution in the country,” Thano said.\nAttached to this section is an SPD statement entitled “Socialize sex work.”\nIn response to Social German media discussion, Social Democratic Party leader Angela Merkel said an alternative solution is to abolish police powers to introduce increased surveillance of sex workers in order to protect the rights of the workers.\nThe SPD supports extension of tax exemptions for prostitutes at government-run sex operations to allow them to work, as well as stricter controls to ensure that those going there do not end up locked up, she said.\nThe community of sex workers sees porn everywhere and sex workers in locations like Berlin and Cologne wearing illegal Brazilian bikinis and dresses. But business in Berlin, where transgender prostitutes make up only a small number of clients, has grown since Freiburg led the country in adopting a sexual tourism policy in 2016.\nThe non-profit organisation that runs Freiburg’s House-Sex Workers aimed to reduce sexual prostitution using measures that aim to increase the level of sex work in the city.\n']"

846,How a vital record of Mexican indigenous life was created under quarantine,"[""Younam of Nuevo la Model T is a proud member of the Queanera family of Afro-Orca descendants of Inuit language community from the Pacific Northwest. He was a lifelong environmentalist (as a childhood endeared him to environmentalist and curmudgeonly journalist) who was raised among environmentalists (and his relatives, like the Nuevo la Model T), but thought that his willingness to live green and practical lives was so unusual he had to support his family by himself. At just 17 years old, he turned his back on environmental activism and joined the clothing industry, and now sets out for the Mayan settlement of Bucau in Peru on the path of family history that has inspired him since childhood.\nWhen he started promoting his project, San Miguel – meaning quintuple – he married an Aztec girl named Sarah. She was the niece of Francisco Padilla, a nephew of Inuit chief Francisco Padilla. Their grandmother Florence Campos Fonseca remained a major figure in her family's history. Indigenous people are more than 50 times more likely to be survivors of sexual or physical violence than their native people, and that knowledge could provide clues to the fate of the Inuit people. So, what is their history and why was it important for him to follow it all?\nFrom the anthropological perspective, the idea behind San Miguel is to encourage indigenous women who might have no formal position in civil law to follow their dreams. He recognizes the science behind that – that the Inuit are more interested in protecting all aspects of their lives. But, it is also a matter of culture.\nThis year, in consultation with an anthropologist and university staff, San Miguel returned to Earth the previous year with his partner, Nuevo la Model T, an indigenous woman. His sister Alejandro was an Inuit girl recruited into her family's indigenous youth program as a messenger and has helped the event succeed in student life.\nThe spirit of traditional values transcend traditional rituals and customs and human greed has created a relaxed, wide-ranging tradition that captures the richness of recent times. US scholars and anthropologists are closely observing the direction of language in which indigenous communities are becoming important sources of cultural identity. These reforms make it more about the integrity of the voice of indigenous people than style; and endangers the cycle of colonization, victimization and native natural resources. The efforts to preserve native culture is particularly critical given the continuing deterioration of the landscape and history.\nSan Miguel does not simply return to the western culture and tradition; he is transforming it in a way that is vital to our economic future. From the current climate of maritime life, with all the dire pressures and pressures of climate change, yet as modern ecosystems progress into long term solar systems, New Mexico could face challenging challenges to preserve its biodiversity. This is the critical stage for open-source research that continues to validate life science practices that came with the introduction of offshore wind turbines. And it is important that we sustain the community's civil protection efforts even after climate change occurs.\nImagine you are prepared to relocate or close down, hope to go to another culture, or to close down a long-held tradition. Your passion and commitment might be greater – who would you marry if someone told you that your soul was a vessel for thousands of miles? Will the experience of San Miguel get you closer to home, or may you fail and decide to replace your love and passion with another culture? You will have reasons to risk and disappoint others.\nI know the irony of living with disease because I don't feel great one way or the other and feel my humanity in every part of it – including from indigenous women, children, and elders of the community. I fear, however, the mistakes that will destroy our existing culture will taste deep down in my soul. Whatever happens, the final experiment in his life needs to be a good one.\n• San Miguel presents its production to Latin America's largest indigenous community in the southeastern region of Peru with a concert on Saturday, April 28, at 4 p.m. at the Kapiolani Cultural Center. The performance marks San Miguel's 10th celebration of indigenous music and culture.\nRead the original article on San Miguel Pacifica. Copyright 2020. Follow San Miguel Pacifica on Twitter.\n""]"

The total number of injuries recorded has surged to 70.\nA member of the public voiced her concern over the impact of CI’s scope on rural hospitals.\nBolstered by a decision to put two stranded Patients’ Hospital locations on the AEDT (AEDC) threshold, the officials said they could take other options.\nThey announced plans to close the Heart of Wales hospital at greater Neath.\nThe Ministry of Health said the closure would give staff at the nine hospitals between them three “choice”.\nUnder the new structure, the result of having 11 control centres across hospitals will increase the number of individual assistant and allied care centres in Britain and decrease the number of “lowest ranked” practices at the Royal Victoria Infirmary or Queen Elizabeth Hospital.\nIts closure would also mean the 24 patients who make up the Upper Medicinohalli babies unit were re-resigned to care for them in which they could practice their elective minimisation procedures.\nIt would mean the need for “sharing” with existing providers around the extent of their stay will increase.\nThe government would not say what the result would be, but admitted the move would add to the challenges facing rural hospitals.\nCouncillor Paul Scanlon, regional vice-chair of the Geelong North Council, which represents regional services in the region, said: “All our rural patients need access to the excellent and flexible care they demand from us.\n“However, now at the same time the situation in the small regions remains even more concerning.\n“We know they are already facing an impact on their procedures which it is clear has come as a result of our experience in Ipswich – all the more reason we should stress this, not make it worse.”\nNHS Minister Steve Ciobo told the KPMG survey: “I think we need to do more to reduce health costs and ultimately reduce the drag on rural communities where vulnerable adults are the most vulnerable.”\nHe said the Government’s priority was to regain the stability and make rural hospitals more efficient.\n']"
850,Life in the time of the coronavirus: Photos from around the world,"[""The coronavirus brings a particular impact, particularly for a biosecurity risk due to infection where a person may be exposed to unprotected exposure.\nPeople should be aware of symptoms of the coronavirus such as fever, headache, mouth or tongue, a rash or cough, tiredness and loss of appetite.\nDiagnoses of the virus need to be taken with caution, especially for those who do not have very specific symptoms or cannot be used as a precaution.\nThere are eight common causes of coronavirus infection. Research has shown that there are three major causes in the blood of disease with around seven per cent of cases being the relatively rare events, ranging from a pandemic to a cold-like illness.\nThe only relatively common cases of the coronavirus is in persons who were exposed to only one virus - that may be transmitted through contaminated food.\nNo one has been diagnosed as the main cause. The symptoms of coronavirus infection include fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, heavy red blood cells and seizures. These symptoms may have been caused by an infection using an infected cigarette or virus.\nOnly three cases are associated with a vaccine, although the vaccine is shown to reduce the risk of a vaccine failure.\nThe three causes of the coronavirus are human, human papillomavirus (HPV) and human papillomavirus (HPV).\nPeople who have never had previously had a medical test or had vaccination with antiviral medications have a higher chance of having the infection. In fact, some people may have the virus in their blood after the first contact with the infected person.\nPeople who have acquired the virus from contaminated foods have the least chance of a vaccine failure, as they take the antiviral medications before getting into the sick person's blood.\nThere is an estimated five times higher infection rate among the people taking the vaccine as compared to those receiving their antiviral medicines. A loss of immunity can lead to the infection. In most cases the person has been exposed to the infection; however, the virus can contaminate the human vaccine.\nTwo cases of human papillomavirus are associated with influenza. The first case is associated with having the virus treated with the antifungal vaccine - Valspar Pasteur - whereas the second is associated with phytophourism or squamous cell anaemia.\nResearch has shown that patients who have no history of symptoms of the disease are more susceptible to an infection. They have a better chance of getting sick if treated immediately.\nIn September this year, the US confirmed the deaths of nine people in Queensland, five of whom had had the influenza virus. The Queensland government reported eight dead Australian citizens over a five-month period.\nOfficials said the sick may have needed virology support from the authorities to treat an outbreak with risk factors, including a relationship between the virus and trauma and personality disorders.\nThere has been a seven-year search for a cause of the disease in Australia.\nThe coronavirus was discovered at an altitude of 14,500 metres in Brazil in 1983.\n""]"

The first time, they get the diagnosis at around age 14 and a few weeks later the follow-up is not necessary. The problem is even worse if they overdoctorise a symptom later – say, leading to intrusive thoughts or thoughts of death.\nDebates will soon be dominated by a new family interest study and this may change the way we look at cancer patients and the treatment. It might be time to start getting head to head with a conversation about what’s wrong with cancer and why we should be doing something about it – and start tackling it.\nIt happens more often in young patients, and some patients may never respond to the thought test until they’ve had it already, says Dr Alice Budden, director of Patient Education and Research at Newcastle University Medical School.\nThe headache is worse for younger patients – as the man’s head cannot comprehend what’s happening, instead, being massively depressed. And that, in turn, kills the remainder of the patient’s motor neurons and cause brain damage.\nMany 20 year olds get the symptoms early. But she says the link between the symptoms and subsequent treatment doesn’t appear in the younger patients, so long as you begin with a familiar, detailed diagnosis. The WestSwan study suggests it’s important to start slowly, avoid having a third type of patient show symptoms – without a period of a longer time delay.\nThe reason why you might not start the treatment as soon as you feel the symptoms start – if your head isn’t settled at 80 per cent, you start with just a relatively small trial.\nOver last eight years Dr Budden has taken on more demanding conditions such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery. Her new study suggests it’s not a good idea to start with a second non-coagulant breast cancer. Most women go on treatment like this for more than five years and a 50 per cent drop in underlying cancer cases is troubling, says Dr Budden.\nShe says: “In some people who come to me with prostate cancer for treatment but then are told to stop, the medicine will not kill them but it will help.”\nDr Budden will be appearing at a cancer research conference in central America, Melbourne, next month.

856,Will California’s coronavirus crisis look like Italy’s soon?,"['They don’t let go of the food on the menu, the caterpillars, the flora, the bedbugs. The next time they come to sell food for sale on a sofa, for example, they will be very skeptical.\nThis spring, the food world won’t be so Zen. A shortage of seedstock, of seeds used for farming, has snuffed out a good crop in California and the future could be very bleak.\n“If seedstock runs out in California,” one executive noted, “it will leave our agricultural world looking in the direction of other countries, where it’s more difficult to buy seeds at the peak of the global economic downturn. It is highly likely that Southern California will be the next obvious destination for stockmeal deliveries.”\nIf we’re to believe the word “relatively” in describing a burst of supply, (available seeds and stockories are precious commodities in the sense that they provide family incomes and provide a safe haven to investment bankers that are unaffected by economic troubles and other financial crises), seeds are the stuff of history. They’re the lifeblood of agricultural production, forcing some farmers into raptures. They preserve their land and protect it from predators, pests and fungus, and many economies in this area supply and care for this rare plant.\nCalifornia’s food supply is in peril. The projected inventory of public land, area crops and endowments is more than half empty and half used. Many states, especially in California, have already collapsed from the flood of agricultural development. In addition, the expected housing bust could result in some states having to quit taking on agricultural projects that are not in good shape and job creation that is downright impossible. The industry currently spends hundreds of millions of dollars cleaning its mess every year.\nAn entire county in Ohio could be ill-positioned to finance or even create the needed fresh water. Elidim, the game-changing organic crop, is thriving in Cincinnati. The biggest agricultural bloc in the country, which is rapidly losing population and acreage, is the California strawberry industry. Scientists already know what a pot should do, they know how much nitrogen and phosphorus to make it clean and profitable, they know how to grow wheat, they know how to extract the fertilizer from the ground, and they know how to harvest both heavy agricultural and industrial crops (relatively small).\nIf one is to believe the food universe, the volatility of food prices to a dozen destinations is feeding increased speculation of the Next Food Move. Why buy seeds? Because the purpose of seedstock is to use the control we currently have for production to avoid yet another parasitic disease that blights the land and crops of every region and territory in America.\n']"

858,To wear a mask or not? Experts answer coronavirus protection questions,"['Most Canadians know that their coronavirus screening kit is routinely screened for common skin and skin colouring, but how do they do it? An analysis of more than 50,000 Canadian cases of the viral disease, the coronavirus, has revealed two major tips for improving their healthy habits.\nTo prevent detection, it is important that you wear a mask or hoodie whenever you go to the doctor’s office to ensure you stay safe during the screening. Like dental hygienists, it’s advisable to wear the protective visor on your body with your overall body length between 7-10 cm.\nHere are some questions you may need to ask first:\nHow many shots do you have each month?\nMedical services are screening patients to ensure you can be fully healthy and get that very quality service. But who’s responsible for administering the screening?\nYou may need to get your medication history of the disease before you need it. The majority of herpes outbreaks are without diagnosis, or even exist, according to the National Institutes of Health, so the agency recommends that you keep track of your vaccination history, and have photos of your vaccination to show when it happened. The beauty of this is that, if you have been immunized for a long time, you’re not going to use over-the-counter antiviral medications in the future. Another important factor, it is important to provide your physician with your history of the disease in order to protect you against the virus.\nIs the coronavirus transmitted from one person to another?\nIn most cases, the virus is isolated to one person. If a contact is infection with the virus, the person may not show symptoms of respiratory disease. However, if a second person is infected with the virus, the spread is very difficult to control. People who suffer a rare flu-like illness need to start their hygiene routine immediately. Avoid constantly holding food or drink with cold medicines and apply a wipe to their skin regularly in the office until symptoms appear. When you see a bleeding or a ruptured wall of mucus, never touch surfaces that have sustained contact. Additionally, if you see a bleeding and dead tissue in your mouth, think about calling a doctor. Or, if you’re in the middle of an influenza-like outbreak, remember you should always ask your physician to get the virus tested so they can determine whether the patient has survived. The infection can damage the membranes that support the airways and prevent cell death.\nWhen did the coronavirus enter Canada?\nThe virus was discovered in British Columbia and Quebec, and has so far infected more than 150 people worldwide. However, there is still much work to be done to track and detect the virus, since the virus can be detected and treated by another factor in the blood. More than nine million Canadians still have symptoms of influenza, and death is almost four times more than that (647,000 cases), but the viral disease is too common for its current distribution in Canada. Much research indicates that the 2009-10 pandemic in China allowed the virus to proliferate in that country and spread to 40 other provinces and territories. By 2018, this particular pandemic is forecast to have killed 450,000 Canadians. On the ground, the pandemic is still at a height, since 27 million people have been infected or appear to have succumbed to the virus.\nFind out more about the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the physician-approved treatment for infectious diseases, and more.\nSOURCE: National Institutes of Health\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnOVTXZs97jQ\nImage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqyjswSwW4my\n']"

Hakman\'s friendship with Mikah May, the historian-activist who found herself working with Hirsen Hakman, and with the German Foreign Ministry\'s archives kept his background from becoming even more prominent.\nThe Hakmans settled in Manhattan\'s Westchester County, where they also lived, Mintz said. As with other New Yorkers, Hakman and his family relocated to East Rockaway, a former borough of the South End, from which they hiked in the Hudson Valley, Mintz said.\nThe Hakmans moved to the wealthy Bohemia section of St. Boniface in 1981 to visit their son, who attended St. Boniface while on service to the U.S. Army in the Vietnam War.\nIn 1990, Rakken Hakman won a U.S. national medal for ""work following efforts of survivors in survivors\' movements, in which, he built the memorial wall of their memory in Saint Boniface.\nBut Hakman\'s job took a back seat to his family\'s history, Mintz said.\n""He trusted my mother.

There\'s no known vaccine against the virus, and the WHO forecasts 1.3 million cases and 1.4 million to 1.4 million deaths by 2023, at a cost of about $40 billion to $60 billion annually.\nHealth officials said they\'re already running out of masks to prepare for the worst, such as those made in Europe, where several dozen more are getting tested.\nIn the meantime, doctors say they need to get machines to clean human cells from infected cells and to wash and disinfect the stomach and other bodies. Ebola has carried the death toll from that virus in West Africa. There\'s a vaccine for first-line treatment, and in the world\'s health capitals, especially China, hospitals are first-line.\nIn Mexico, lawyers said the rapid growth of coronavirus cases has led to an unparalleled torrent of medical care for the infant and young. Experts say the prime suspect in the infant death is too young for his own doctor to be prepared to administer them and should seek treatment from other doctors or security guards.\nPeople from the previously unknown community of warring southern neighbors currently living in Mexico\'s cities were having complications despite they had no medical education and no treatment options.\nInstead, they have both been given large plates of meat, sushi, packaged soda and chips, and dined on hot dogs, with limited information on what the vaccine was, said retired professor Joaquin ""El Gordo"" Martinez Angulo.\nHe said there is a role for doctors and nurses, who are on a more regular supply because they have better education, access to better equipment and more space for cover. That\'s why his daughter went to college in El Salvador in January, he said.\nIn an email, a career diplomat with 40 years experience in the Central American country, Flores said many in the community may not realize their family\'s village was put on the line, and that the eruption of children\'s diarrhea can be deadly.\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

862,Sacrifice the old to help the economy? Texas official’s remark prompts backlash,"['Gov. Greg Abbott\'s radio ad that ""God gives us credit for more"" is making waves over in his office. But the Texas governor\'s office refuted his claim.\nAs you know, Abbott was elected governor of Texas in 2014 and has led the state of Texas for almost a year. His message, mainly to conservatives, has been the proverbial ""thank you,"" received high marks so far for going beyond his job as lieutenant governor and keeping voters united behind him.\nSpecifically, Abbott has praised those who make important decisions: ""As Texas, we fight for women\'s reproductive rights, we fight for our economic freedom, we fight for our environment, and we fight for our people\'s safety, and we fight for our future prosperity.""\nIt\'s a notably greater profile in the news cycle than Abbott\'s prior words, but hey, good spirits can get you a job.\nReporter Olin Goold on Wednesday said Abbott\'s comments were ""a curious comment.""\n""He didn\'t answer the question. Why was he talking about something that we really do think is an important, thoughtful way to carry out the good works that government is trying to do in Texas?""\nIf the governor, in his radio ad and online, meant to say God gave us credit for more for state of Texas, he did so without giving a second thought to the gift of abortion rights.\nAbbott\'s comments about state health care are a much-hyped initiative. Doctors generally take their medical services for granted. About the only exceptions for abortion-related disputes are when their providers choose not to deliver the live birth and medical procedures that are placed in favor of someone else.\nSo if the governor of Texas thought abortion rights were better, I am not sure there was much more to say. Not that most Texans believe in the founding fathers\' vision of federalism.\nBut Abbott\'s campaign says he\'ll correct the problem when he\'s elected.\n""His policy, as discussed by Texans, is that he supports criminalization of abortion. That\'s why his initiative is supported by the abortion rights groups that govern his office,"" the press release states.\nNevertheless, every issue Abbott has taken on, every issue not even mentioned in the ad, is accompanied by a smattering of ""God bless Texas"" flags.\n']"

864,Singapore says its coronavirus app helps the public. Critics say it’s government surveillance,"['Singapore’s coronavirus app is misleading. It’s not a good cause to check your doctor’s appointments.\nIn other words, the app is incomplete. You’re with your loved ones at work and they are trying to get a word in edgewise with the boss.\nThe world’s greatest coronavirus outbreak — its total death toll has crossed one million — was a symptom of a new type of infectious disease that can affect carriers of the virus, diseases where coronavirus has proved elusive.\nEven though it took a fraction of a second before the public becomes aware of it, experts are concerned it is only a matter of time before it spreads.\nThis month, a team led by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has traced the spread of the virus to eight companies.\nIt raised concerns that within hours of its being released to the public, its buzzing RNA which was reported as being a “code-negative” can cause people to misdiagnose it as a disease.\nThe NIAID also found it should have been treated earlier with advice from its doctors to make sure no one had a fever or cough.\nThe survey results illustrate the major problem we have with the emerging epidemic of coronavirus, which is a global pandemic. The public has an equal opportunity to question the workings of the health system and make laws.\nEqually important, this is having serious, massive health-related impacts on millions of people around the world.\nThe survey of more than 11,000 high-level elected officials in 14 other countries, from the US to Indonesia, both learned about the catastrophic trend.\nIn some cases, it found, the public relied on government surveillance services to inform the public about problems and alert officials not to mention the viruses.\nThe result was an alert that ran for 24 hours.\nThe technology used to apply the protection has found solutions to public concerns. But it won’t solve these long-term health problems.\nPublic needs, in all its forms, vigilance and collaboration to prevent outbreaks. These diseases are endemic, and they all go unrecognised.\nThe proven, high-quality system for detecting the spread of coronavirus is on hold, until now.\nAnd today’s coronavirus outbreak is in Asia, so it’s relatively rare.\nIt’s not clear how quickly the scourge will spread across the world. The laboratory now serves a global outbreak that is anywhere from eight to 14 weeks old.\nThe ANSI report finds that the health system suffers “lack of accountability, resilience and readiness.”\nThe AIM warned governments and regions that new research should “accelerate” or else the public will lose trust and confidence in the systems.\nOf the 40,000 deaths from the outbreak last year, almost 4,000 were preventable, but the cure rate is 30 per cent or less.\nPrivate companies are doing much better and public health experts are hoping the end will come soon.\nThese three are telling tales of bravery, but they need good communication. This week, NIAID’s chief Andrew Kirby committed to “leading the change” that the public needs from the super-coronavirus.\nInformation is one way to not get caught. It can’t be overtaxed by bureaucratic acquiescence.\nIn this we are one step closer to a new technological and human approach to preventing an outbreak.\nThis colleague, Charles Peters, is a former director of the world’s largest blood bank of aged people.\n[Source: The Inquirer]\n']"
865,Trump and governors in heated debate over saving lives versus the economy,"[""They each promote policies that would help low-income people - and the other elective posts are all to blame for last month's death toll.\nPresident Donald Trump's administration imposed a 1 percent cap on those tax increases on federal income taxes to help combat the opioid crisis, which is expected to nearly double over the next three years, and has cut $17 billion from the healthcare insurance market.\nYet for Republicans and Democrats, the difference between the spending reductions and the impact of Trump's policies was stark.\nDemocratic leaders explained to Trump over the weekend that allowing insurance companies to charge middle-class Americans more to avoid taxes might be even more harmful than letting rate hikes on the wealthy, blaming them for provoking deeper spending cuts.\nScroll down for video\nPresident Donald Trump (right) said Trump's order allowing insurers to charge more on the poor without taxes could end up draining the budget deficit. But Republicans counter that Obamacare and Medicare were the driving force\nTrump criticized Democrats in the White House for the order while talking about his wishes to cut spending, a development leaders from Trump's party said was flawed.\n'There's no way to think about whether it was a good idea for a president to limit the economy's ability to help people in the private sector by taking away the health insurance coverage that millions of people rely on,' Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said, according to Bloomberg.\nStill, Republicans are also concerned about President Trump's plan to slash his own national debt - which they said is part of his plans to stifle growth.\nTrump put aside the argument Thursday he should increase taxes on those who pay a lower income tax rate. He contended that it was 'disappointing' that the administration's budgetary plan is delaying payments for veterans to their pensions from his budget proposals.\nRepublicans instead defended the policy that gave poorer families a tax break because they can be poor by buying a smaller home, taking their child out of school and having coverage if they fail to pay taxes.\n'Let's make a real distinction that the best way to benefit low-income families is to extend what we've already achieved in terms of tax relief,' Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas) said to Trump.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, were venting frustration with Trump's plan to cut federal spending, like allowing people to pay a lower income tax rate\nRepublican leaders argue that repealing Obamacare would release tax money from the government for tax-run state governments, but Republicans insisted that cutting the taxes for people earning less than $175,000 per year, would prevent cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.\nTax overhaul goes before Congress next month, so policy makers are still sifting through how far to cut government.\nA new study by research firm Proxy Data Group, also released Thursday, shows that while the federal deficit declined by a net $52 billion in the first nine months of the year, a loss of $1.2 trillion over the same period would have meant an increase of $377 billion in the federal debt.\nThe national debt hit a record $7 trillion last year, from a deficit of $242 billion to the deficit of $298 billion, according to a study by a payroll and investment services firm.\nThe top 10 percent of taxpayers received only 0.3 percent of the taxes Trump sought to cut, while the bottom half received about 0.5 percent.\nThe report's authors took the average income of the top 10 percent of earners in the three-year period, not including the highest earners. It found the income of the 1 percent is higher than in the years before the previous administration did not cut taxes.\nTax rates, meanwhile, rose due to the tax cuts President Trump has presented for Congress to raise money for Medicaid and other federal programs.\n""]"
866,"Fearing new round of coronavirus, mask-wearing Hong Kong targets barefaced foreigners","['HONG KONG, China — New Zealand is offering masks that could be hiding a sinister behind castains and blood thinners. Hong Kong authorities are looking for barefaced foreigners in a bid to stamp out the biggest coronavirus outbreak on record in an impoverished city that for decades has been sealed off from outsiders.\nThe toughest tests will take place today when officials at a disaster response center in northern Hong Kong said they’re teaming up with monks of the Buddhist Monastery on a campaign to discourage what they believe is a new safety risk.\nThe website of the website of the Fu Shi Sculpture Society, a group that has ties to the Islamic Society of Hong Kong and overseas, appears to confirm what some of its followers have been saying for months: that one of its monks has castadoping puppies in thistles, or prints in glasses and nipple plugs.\nUnlike deadly coronavirus cases that sank China after a decade-long government crackdown, the fresh threat is a development that could push New Zealand to reconsider its ban on commercial flights to Hong Kong to protect public health. Other nations such as the Philippines and the Philippines have sought permission to carry out surgical sterilizations, according to health officials.\nThere’s little information on the origins of the outbreak, with the recent deaths in Beijing and in Hong Kong of rare coronavirus coronavirus cases as well as those in Italy and Greece in 2010 and 2011. Some Hong Kong officials — including state health administrator Edward Wong — have acknowledged the outbreak has been a surprise in local media. Hong Kong health officials also said Friday they’re continuing to test the hand islammy, a blood thinner that measures the bacteria that results from a blood clot that resists and can delay labor and enable cancer-fighting cells to recover.\nThe lack of flu vaccines in Beijing and then in Beijing in 2008, prompted the government to ban permanent vaccination and a long ban on tourists and people coming over from China for family reunions after they left the country or suffered complications that ultimately left them in a coma.\nThe problem has yet to be fully addressed in Hong Kong, where the city is considered autonomous and with even more stringent safety laws than in most mainland Chinese cities. The city’s mayors said on Friday they’ve opened their offices to check if anyone else had been caught up in the latest outbreak.\nNew Zealand is on a similar offensive to push for immediate bans and inspections of traditional Chinese burial sites, or “breaches of the law.” Those should be withheld until the cause is identified and can be reimbursed, said Thayne Banniwo, a spokesman for the New Zealand Office of Medical Services.\nHong Kong is the nation’s most restrictive safety pact, banning tourists from setting up gun and metal detectors outside tourist parlors, driving them home for overnight visits only, photographing women before going to sleep, requiring them to take blood samples without the appropriate medical training or other medical screening and banning practices in which they can ask for allergy tests or medical advice.\n']"

868,"In Louisiana, death comes before coronavirus test results","['BATON ROUGE, La. (KBOYG) – People living in the Crescent City, particularly those with grandsons and some grandchildren, are dying before coronavirus tests have results, according to officials.\nHealth officials say there are a few ways to prevent death or disease in children in Louisiana. An immunization could prevent several deaths or be life-threatening.\nBlue Cross Louisiana and Blue Shield found the following three signs of the ROCN variant of the bug, which can cause serious and fatal illness: an eight-day decline in number of sick days; nausea and vomiting; diarrhea; and a generally low rate of bowel movement.\nThe toxicology report warns that “certain foods may contain raspberries, hazelnuts, strawberries and peaches, and some flavors of the banana can contain the ROCN variant. Some of the common foods in the label may contain a combination of five potent glomerulosclerosis protein-rich foods, including chocolate, chocolate cake, coffee and peanut butter.”\nIn Louisiana, two major hotels have contracted ROCN cases, including the first case of the cyclophosphamide virus confirmed by the Mississippi Health Center. The Port Arthur, Texas, facility received the illness on March 20 and it has confirmed six other cases. The cause of the illness has not been determined, but an internal survey has shown ROCN.\nThe ROCN variant is quite often found during childhood, under the skin and occasionally in the mouth. Each year, at least one species of ROCN is identified that exhibits the same symptoms — nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, diarrhea, diarrhea, fever, and a generally low level of stool. Sometimes it is detected and passed on to children.\nWhen a person experiences symptoms, ROCN is used as a test to distinguish between “healthy” and “dangerous” foods like peanuts, soybean oil, and blueberries. The only measure of the ROCN variant is whether it has spread to humans.\nROCN is previously well-known as a highly contagious, viral infection, but didn’t cause disease until 1921. It is being advised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to avoid eating any types of food that contains the ROCN variant. All JSA patients will need to rest and eat rather than drink water and snacks.\nAccording to the CDC, most outbreaks of ROCN are contracted when a person is over 20 years old. Some early symptoms include fatigue, headaches, weight loss, and waistlines swollen beyond their zodiac signs, causing them to struggle to move. When illness flares, when severe illness occurs, be careful and check with your doctor regularly about the ROCN variant, or risk hospitalization.\nParticipants in the study can also plan a future trip to a doctor if they feel ill.\n“Over the last couple years, we’ve seen some relatively safe ways of catching this a relatively easy way,” health department Director Dan McDaniel said. “They can be delivered directly to a health facility and processed easily in a clinic, and upon arrival, they’re usually sterile.”\nSymptoms can begin with a shallow stutter. These symptoms continue throughout adulthood but can change over time.\nMcDaniel says if patients show other signs of symptoms and symptoms are consistent with bacterial or viral activity, emergency department visits may be appropriate for their hospitalization.\n']"
869,Deal reached on $2-trillion coronavirus stimulus bill — largest by far in U.S. history,"['WASHINGTON — U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday passed legislation that will cap the amount of money raised from foreign investments and spur efforts to reform Washington’s government to clean up the U.S. health care system, though they declined to confirm the deal.\nThe measure effectively will let the Federal Reserve, not the government, increase its benchmark overnight interest rate just days before regulators review changes that could impact insurers and other insurers. The legislation became law without the Democratic leaders’ support in Congress, a sign that President Donald Trump’s ally Senate Republicans were expected to fail to reach a deal with a GOP-led Senate.\nThe House and Senate passed similar bills last year. In December, they passed Senate Finance Committee legislation that allows the U.S. Treasury to start reissuing bond rates with larger operations. Congress also restored Wall Street bailout funds but took no action.\nRepublicans are pressing ahead with a bold plan to overhaul the American health care system by reducing tax revenue for wealthy corporations and individuals using the money to pay for their insurance premiums. Trump, pushing back against congressional Democrats on details, said the plan had been “dead on arrival” and should be resurrected.\nHealth care has long been a priority of Trump, who favors a different kind of health care system from current ones. He has long championed reforms to improve health care coverage, but the Republican-led House and Senate legislation passed in January has faced resistance from Republicans in both houses of Congress who sought “legislative sabotage” of the bill.\nThe legislation is similar to the House version in a way intended to blunt the risk of damage to the bill. But it could have a greater “windfall” for taxpayers who are less financially dependent on their employer insurance or on their employer’s contributions than now would be, said Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., co-chairman of the House Health and Human Services Committee.\nThe Health and Human Services bill would keep a much lower benchmark rate as an insurance policy rather than an industrial policy, just like the House version, said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.\nThe bill does not go further to fix the nation’s aging health care systems, so the House and Senate legislation are “relatively similar,” he said.\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement that the legislation, which had an expected Senate approval, should help offset the costs of reforming health care.\n“The Medicare and Medicaid system needs to reform, but the administration does not believe adding trillions of dollars in unnecessary costs for the United States will occur,” Mnuchin said.\n']"

The Hotel and Casino, which is the namesake of the resort’s namesake, said its wine, food and drink machines are safe.\n“Unfortunately our hotel in the Pin is in immediate jeopardy of having to close indefinitely,” the Associated Press said.\nThe scope of the situation isn’t completely clear, but the hotel reported that it had advised employees to contact their employers if there was any information about the investigation. The Pope recently condemned the general public for taking “countless lives” in a 1989 letter published in the Vatican. And it’s been noted that Las Vegas Sands gives annual or unique taxpayer funds to local charities through its gambling.\nMeanwhile, on July 1 the American Cancer Society announced its 10th year-round operating ban of Quicken Loans Arena.\n“Quicken Loans Arena remains committed to supporting the United States Cancer Society as an important and supportive service center to the community through grants, supports, donations and programs which support their mission of fighting cancer,” according to a company press release.\nThe Community Bank of the Valley in Gallipoli will continue to serve as the host community bank in coming years.\nThe cancellations come after months of speculation over whether the replacement of the hotel with what is supposed to be a separate development, St. Paul’s of Las Vegas, would be true. BMO Harris Bank, another developer involved in the St. Paul’s-Las Vegas expansion, visited Las Vegas in February, 2018, and first spoke to newspaper reporters over the weekend.\nBut CBA wasn’t specific on what it would do about the expansion, or any news about it. But when first spoke to reporters in late February, it made an announcement expressing plans to open the hotel by 2024. The company also said it would handle upgrades, including landscaping and amenities, for the current hotel and casino.\nLouis Ardabe, CBA’s general manager, said the Hilton Planet Booking, operated by the hotel itself, would also cancel or shut down any future hotel’s activities. The company’s bookings wouldn’t be impacted, he said.\n']"

But Senate Republicans rejected the offer, sparking protests from Mexican immigrants with ties to Donald Trump.\nOfficials said they were encouraging the homecoming of more than 3,000 detainees, plus thousands of other deportees. They also were working to mobilize tens of thousands of immigrants who could help the reintegrate them into the country.\nRecapturing undocumented immigrants who escaped from El Salvador and Nicaragua as teenagers will depend on U.S. taxpayer money. Officials have recommended the transfer of the rest of the undocumented immigrants to areas of the country with significant influxes, such as Texas, Nevada and Florida.\nThey will be sent to Miami to await U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation hearings. They will also be issued a temporary hold on their cases until the U.S. Supreme Court cases are decided.\nImmigrant advocates welcomed the news, and said they were especially hopeful that it could steer this week’s Trump administration into an earlier decision not to deport immigrants coming from many of the countries on the list of 35 countries where Trump’s administration has been responsible for deportations.\n“There is anger, disappointment, disgust,” said one member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, a group representing more than 90 Democratic lawmakers. “I am here to say that we are disappointed by the outcome. We need to unite all of us behind immigration reform.”\nSome 45 immigrant families of origin were still living in camps over a year after Trump’s announcement. Other families were stymied by delays after having threatened to beat deportation.\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported more than 1,000 immigrant families in the first wave of deportations.\nFor weeks, an administration legal aid fund, the Immigration Legal Aid Fund, has been working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to help families trying to help themselves.\nICE spokesman Jason Levine said some 3,000 of the deportees were children under 12, and another more than 200 were adults.\n“What happens in isolation is tragic, and it is unexpected. But we will move forward,” he said.\nICE recommends 20 to 30 refugee and asylum applications, which are considered must-complicated but do not go to a court-ordered hearing, and on average waits an average of 4.5 days before deportation proceedings are allowed.\nBased on this scenario, Congress would have the final say. It is unclear how far members of Congress would take the proposal.\nFor the DACA immigrants who arrived in the United States through Mexico in 1965, DACA is a “bona fide” U.S. policy. Its validity is up for appeal in the U.S. Supreme Court.\nHowever, U.S. laws prohibit hundreds of thousands of them from being issued permanent legal status at any point in their lifetime.

Red states lag blue in stay-at-home orders,"['Rublin, a personal finance consultant, penned an essay in San Diegan magazine with the pen name of Joseph Rublin once he checked into one of the city’s malls. He was one of many entrepreneurs drawn to upscale neighborhoods to learn about non-meat eaters. ""If everybody had food, it would never be a bad idea,"" he wrote. ""This place is one of the most amazing and enjoyable locations to dine in."" But the shopping space he’d seen was so overrun with new technology that he left it behind. He’d noticed that the shops didn’t keep up with the additional technology needed to update them. It was an impulse the same way that all the new windows that barter were coming in from other parts of town were adding up. As an example of how people split their interest in cars, he made a photocopy of the vehicle of a teenage relative while trying to pull a car from the parking lot and landed on the floor. The anecdote, which has been edited and condensed for greater clarity, illustrates how tech is shifting the dynamics of a city. Texas is doing so well that now 17 of the state’s top 20 indicators of stay-at-home-ordering are based in Texas, according to an analysis by YouGov. (Their database of leading indicators of dining and staying-at-home orders by city is here) Meanwhile, Florida is ahead of most of the other states in stay-at-home-ordering, at 23.5 percent. Four of Texas’ Top 20 indicators of stay-at-home-ordering are in Florida: TacoBell, Pizza Hut, Chipotle and Chick-fil-A. The lone report measuring stay-at-home-ordering for Florida is OnLine. That offering, while up from just 7 percent three years ago, is more heavily weighted toward women than men. Many Hispanic women are turning to dining out and the greater novelty of being at home to escape family photos reveals that Texas residents are more inclined to spend time with their kids than ever before. Looking at national data, they also appear to be cutting back at the adult turn-ons that longer-term trends suggest would guarantee success.\n']"

In the last parliament in 2015, Prime Minister David Cameron railed against a vote in the British parliament to cut Cameron\'s EU budget in half - Britain\'s budget.\nBrussels wants that to happen, but is refusing to bend over backwards to meet basic EU deadlines to hit them halfway, including some 40 million euros ($42 million) this year to stop politicians from reducing carbon emissions from power plants and expanding green energy.\nLabour opposition parties are also pressing for a cut in 2015\'s European Union budget to fund clean energy projects in countries like the United States and Brazil, two climate change sceptics close to Britain who also fear the cheapest renewable technologies could be the only alternative.\n($1 = 0.8452 euros)\n(Reporting by Carolyn Cohn and Giulia Segreti; editing by James Jukwey)\n']"

877,"In the end, Holocaust survivor couldn’t outlast virus, becoming Israel’s first COVID-19 fatality","['A member of “The Bridge of Spies”-ONE of the deadliest acts of Nazi Germany’s Holocaust, the nine-year-old boy from Brussels died April 1 from a virus that spread from his stomach, opening the door to a severe infection.\nHe was ten years old and weighing 630 pounds at the time of his death. He survived the painful death and presumed bones from a bullet wound outside his stomach. He is expected to have kidney failure and additional life-threatening organ failure, not to mention another life-threatening infection.\n“This is a final disappointment to us, and we’re being sad,” he’s reading out to his parents, Yitzhak and Anat Lot, of Brussels, Belgium, at their home.\nFrom the hospital, a team of brain doctors had grown tired of the side effects of the virus, and decided to find a solution. Doctors in Brussels found that the boy, to transmit his kind of viral infection from his belly, would die of skin graft rejection.\nSeveral days later, a family member returned and informed the special care group at the geriatric section at the University Hospital of Brussels.\nHaving prepared the boy’s body, the children’s interior minister, Kevin Friedenburg, assured them that he had “the best possible go.”\nFriedenburg told the children that doctors who monitor an adult adult could recognize signs that could indicate infection was occurring with the virus, and that should he not be identified, the hospital should lead the way for the child, who might be suffering from an immunity deficiency or infectious disease.\nFriedenburg said he too thought that the boy had already died of an immune deficiency.\nAfter weeks of mounting anxiety, medical staff cut the boy’s stomach with a metal blade and poured plastic over the wound, the skin was shredded, and the building was completely drenched. It was an entirely new form of cancer, a process that led to no cure.\nIt became the centrepiece of a psychological and medical experiment under the banner of the National Primate Research Institute of Belgium, and became an ideal success for Norway, Iceland and Denmark, among other EU countries, where the same doctors had been involved for the past decade.\nAfter the boy died, Göttingen’s Home medical team helped diversify the path of the virus with the help of a Danish contact group and surgeon. The Dutch is conducting an autopsy with the conclusion that the boy died of an immune deficiency in his digestive tract.\nIt was also a phenomenally effective, and profoundly disturbing, approach to many other medical and therapeutic effects of the Holocaust, such as the creation of a map of all the continents and continents of Europe.\nThe goal, Friedenburg explained to children, is to extend the authenticity of the trauma and therapeutic value of the Holocaust, which was finally shown in human hands in 1995.\nThe government had given 300,000 Nazi-era draft prisoners and medical records to researchers, many of them victims, like the five-year-old boy who died March 1, along with hundreds of thousands of other mentally disabled Holocaust survivors.\nBut from a technical standpoint the survivors needed to cough up cash and lose medical records. Instead, they gave what Friedenburg and the Dutch team thought would be a much lower price tag: 70 million Euros, or the equivalent of $1.6 million in 1996.\nAfter extensive research, the researchers came up with a plan for the boy: print out medical records for pediatricians for 20 years from the deceased child. They could monitor him for further use and provide him with the ability to pick and choose which agents of immunoglobulin (ITG) protection he could use instead of giving him the wrong ones, and from time to time the kid would even be measured in other ways.\nAfter the children published the research, the Dutch Government launched an intensive humanitarian effort called “West Holocaust.”\n“There are serious deaths from the Holocaust, but some of these children have never been in contact with their families,” Friedenburg told the Express in an interview this week.\n“So we are taking a massive step forward to some extent, and to help these children start to heal.”\nEuropean cities like Brussels hope their stories might help to improve the efforts of some other countries, such as Norway, Iceland and Denmark, to combat the threat of the Holocaust.\n']"

It would be “unsatisfactory” if those travelers are never found, she said.\nIts Florida division began employing social workers to help passengers and others stranded in Brazilian ports, Muniz Dammata, administrator of the airport that handles them.\nAmir declined to provide any examples of hard times that might have contributed to this cruise strike, which could disrupt operations, airports and the global economy.\nThe goal of the nonprofit organization is to “help families and caretakers prepare to travel to the United States,” said Superhero Kidz, which has spearheaded efforts to provide survivors and others with warm welcome and hospitality.\nAmir said that although all 85,000 survivors of the March 31 Mississippi River cruise ship incident appear to be in good health, nobody appears to be healthy. Some are improving at daycare centers or go on bingo outings, she said. Some have checked in for vacation, but no people are reported in the ship’s quarantined quarantine area.\nMeanwhile, cargo ships and other vessels have been sailing toward the Gulf of Mexico, where much of the ill, convulsing cruise passengers and others remain. One of the most popular nonresidents, Jeremy Stokke, stopped off on Thursday to see a U.S. cargo ship not sailing at the same time. Stokke said he saw the ship floating with 11 people aboard after sinking in the Gulf. The passengers — together with many unable to reach food and water for days after the incident — were staying in an airliner for six nights in Miami. The control tower — which recorded the ship’s whereabouts as miles from shore during the grounding — said the Sewol is headed east.\nIf anyone gets sick at sea, another passenger must be shuttled across the Gulf and give priority to direct patients from hospitals and doctors, said Nicole Cajy — a Miami-based nurse who has spent the past five days checking the condition of any of the people aboard the ship.\n“The luggage is frozen. The staff clothes have been made out of peanut butter,” she said. “We have 10 people on the ship that are sick, and they get in touch with everybody.”\nOn Friday, after avoiding conflict during a short cruise, food and water were delivered to the ship’s controls, according to Cajy. Meanwhile, rescuers in the United States and Brazil flew out to shore and continued monitoring passenger boats, reported the CBS News affiliate, RTE. About six dozen passengers are believed to be in critical condition, though at least one is expected to survive, RTE said.\nAccording to the federal health alert issued Thursday, intestinal infections and stomach disease are the leading cause of death in passengers aboard the cruise ship. Bacteria and other intestinal conditions are some of the biggest threats to life and death in less than a month.\nIn the second largest cruise ship disaster in U.S. history, eight people were killed in the disaster, which occurred Oct. 31, 2016, aboard Carnival Cruise Lines’ Carnival Liberty.\nThis story has been corrected to fix caption of the third paragraph to no longer disclose the cruise ship is in Brazil.\n']"

882,How do you become infected with the coronavirus?,"['Coronavirus\nWhen any human is infected with viral disease, it is usually pre-symptomatic. So in some instances, other people’s bodies are infected, and they do not transmit the virus easily.\nHowever, when the disease is particularly aggressive like interspersed with influenza and measles, it can progress, and spread quickly if transmitted rapidly and efficiently.\nDuring our average breastfeeding cycle or a breastfeeding activity, the virus can bite into a girl in particular and cause her internal organs to rupture and spread the virus.\nHow do you cope with those symptoms?\nNormally, immune system attack attacks can either come from the specific virus – the minor virus or the viral virus – or from the fact that the virus contains a large number of viruses.\nAnother way of coping with this is to prevent the virus from causing infection.\nFor example, if you accidentally swallow a pill, you will naturally pass the flu virus over to your gut and cough up flu-like symptoms (they worsen after that).\nTherefore, it is important to at least assess to what extent the virus may have spread beyond your gut.\nIs infection with the measles virus just a symptom?\nThe viruses that cause measles virus have their own immune system, similar to those that infect a sick parent.\nThis characteristic can lead to progressive infection. But the measles virus does not carry the same simple protein as the measles vaccine – only an antibody.\nWhat are the lessons to learn from flu viruses?\nAvoid hard to detect influenza viruses, even those with relatively small symptoms.\nResearch is also necessary to accurately identify antibodies which can help keep the virus in check.\nGenerally, the measles virus is not so harmful. However, the vaccine needs to have an anti-viral flavivirus, or TAVR (Mishsum virinase), which is then closely correlated with influenza.\nThis FAVR prevents the virus from spreading, especially through coughing, sneezing, contracting body fluids like saliva and urine, which tend to lead to an unusual bit of illness.\nTell us: How do you know when you’ve been infected with Ebola?\nIn the United States, for example, we now see every case of Ebola which involve Ebola, and thousands of people are known to have been infected.\nIt is very important to identify the five stages of infected disease as soon as possible.\nThe earliest and most established stage is usually health problems, such as pneumonia, infections with influenza, pneumonia, and infection with hepatitis.\nIf it’s positive for a cause, this can lead to the transmission of a virus by one of the affected parts.\nIf it’s negative for any reason, we would not recommend any doctor using any medication that would counter the disease (such as intra-antibiotics).\nAt the current stage, the virus may not transmit to another person because it is unrelated to the victim. This is because it transmits the virus in a separate direction from infected person.\nIf the person was infected with influenza, the virus must have sustained for a very long time.\nHow do you feel about contracting the flu?\nNormally, you can and do get the flu, without long-term exposure to long-term infections, although the virus is present if you have a fever.\nA lot of people are comfortable with the concept of staying fit. It is an important step if you are considering getting healthcare or getting vaccinated.\nWhat are your experiences when it comes to the flu?\nIt is very easy to fall for the flu – you just have to take it seriously. But many people are also unwilling to be vaccinated.\nAs a result, the number of people not taking anti-viral medications is high and there are still very few effective antiviral drugs available.\nWe need to study the mortality rates for the virus for people who take these medications, and those who do not take them.\nWhat can you do?\nWe need to thoroughly study these complications so we can better understand them and help them be understood at the earliest stages.\nKeep the dose for yourself.\nDon’t be alarmed if it is not enough for someone on a drugs waiting list.\nThe miracle of the flu could prove that it can help a lot of people but, in the meantime, manage illness by taking these easy-to-detect antiviral medicines.\nMany people, especially in older or homedidually infecting people, probably find the public healthcare system in poor or poor countries more effective than NHS healthcare systems.\nThere is a massive spread of the flu. Often of many is the flu which is very lethal (i.e. it increases the risk of death), and rarely works or is easily treatable.\nHowever, it can just as easily treat two diseases simultaneously (e.g. influenza A and H1N1, a rarely transmissible disease).

Despite everything that went on in my life, I’m thankful that she had mild polio, and it was all to thank for making sure she was safe and healthy. At least at first, that was.\nBut the first warning came when my father got sick with the disease. I was a little concerned that he might not have returned to work. As there was no vaccine available to protect me, he asked my older sister to go out with her boyfriend, brother, and sisters and ring their respective co-workers at First Street Baptist Church in Easton, Mass. In that moment, my children were in the hospital. However, to my surprise, Mylene and her brother knew she was receiving a vaccination.\nI soon realized that they didn’t have measles. It was easy to take this to show my brother that he wasn’t doing poorly. Needless to say, he suffered, and he recovered quickly. Since Mylene had a polio vaccine, my children were left with little to no protection. My brother remained in the hospital for several months, and soon after he became sick again.\nAfter that, Mylene and her two siblings, Jennie and John, passed away. I remember Jennie with a much more serious illness. It was not uncommon for her to pass that quickly. I was sick with pneumonia, and her illness became ever so slightly terminal. Years and years passed, and unfortunately, she became ill again. I don’t know what really happened to her. But fortunately, I was able to safely get through to my younger siblings, and although my kids were safe, my husband and I were put on a little bit of extra vigilance to protect our family. Unfortunately, we had our aging parents fighting for life. Thankfully, my children were all healthy and had been vaccinated and had been fully vaccinated. But it wasn’t until my sister’s illness came about, and she started experiencing headaches, they were short of breath, and she started feeling a little distant, that she asked her doctor if she needed to get a second shot. Luckily, the doctor was so healthy and well that she did.\nI told my son, Jace, my family was going to have a heart attack in their barbeque – what more could you ask for?\nNo one else was at the barbeque. When I was confronted with the question, Jace answered, “Uh-huh!”\nI’m thankful for Jace that he was well during the time that I was in the hospital. But at least he was. Now, Jace and I still have him on a daily basis. I know that there was some medical reason why I wasn’t quite clear on why my children were unwell, but Jace is a young man, and as I recall, I still recall him being this way – he was the primary caregiver.\n']"
888,Experts fear India will be the next coronavirus hotspot,"['People across the country are forced to do little, much less think about dying of cancer or, more specifically, stop smoking, says Dr Akhilesh Soni, a professor of ophthalmology and his team in Delhi.\n""The elderly may catch a second or third infection; 90 per cent of us don\'t follow proper processes and behaviour. We have to effectively put in place measures to prevent infection, namely an immunisation programme, pruning, etc. The older we get, the better"", Dr Soni said.\nMore than 1.6 million Indians have died from non-communicable diseases, including cancer, diabetes and arthritis, due to the lack of immunisation. India plays a leading role in global tobacco industry and besides, the country\'s territory of territories including Bhutan, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Niger, Mali, and Niger represent only 1 percent of India\'s population.\nThe current trends of missed opportunities due to inadequate access to diagnosis and treatment are the responsibility of governments and their doctors. A November survey of 70,000 adults by CLAIRE FOUNDATION found more than 64 per cent failed to use clinical diagnoses and treatments for people being infected with an infectious disease.\n""We need to recognise the fact that there is a need to not only have regular treatment but also use immunisation to protect people from non-communicable diseases, given that we live in a world of war-like circumstance,"" said Salil Kalmadi, a researcher from CLAIRE FOUNDATION.\nIn 2013, the World Health Organisation estimated India as the fourth leading jurisdiction for non-communicable diseases after the US, China, India, Japan, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, Indonesia, and Pakistan.\nMaintaining the quality of prevention policy is a critical ministry responsibility. Further, the HC-GP [on the treatment of disease] is critical to combating the scourge.\nKmadi said ministers have until April next year to implement any law that had been written by the HC-GP that had put him on notice to conduct an oral survey of the members of the public before creating the board for the ministry to appoint any members of the board.\nKmadi, who is also secretary for Bihar, said the government would have to act very quickly if a communicable disease outbreak was reported to have taken place.\n""Doctors and health authorities need to view epidemics as an issue for consideration in the primary prevention strategy so that what they do to spread diseases is not in doubt,"" he said.\nAlso, the government needs to strike a balance between finding adequate measures to ensure patients have access to full immunisation, prevention and treatment and government spending on immunisation programmes. ""Short of money, we don\'t have a dedicated role,"" said Kalmadi.\nHealth professionals and NGOs are also witnessing rising cancer epidemics. A Lancet study, which documents the frequency of suspected cases of cancer in India, has seen growing numbers of cases in the tribal areas.\nIn 2010, 2,251 persons had been diagnosed with a cancer, an increase of 76 per cent over 2010.\nA March report by the Indian Global Health Action Network (IGHAN) and partners of CLAIRE FOUNDATION, estimates that deaths from cancer should be below one million.\nTheir recommendations should include increased monitoring of deaths from cancer, treatment, and prevention, and mandatory testing of people to ensure they have the right to die. They also call for an escalation in and reduce the pace of vaccine development.\n']"

Even those who do plan to go to work are being reminded to check their mailbox in case they walk through.\nAs recently as March, Kim Massey had to cancel dozens of events, so the park didn’t hold one over the weekend.\n“When I knew when it would be extended it was the first time and even more important,” Massey said.\nTuesday morning will be the first time Massey wakes up at 2 a.m. to be tethered to wires. She knows the clothes that keep her there all day, so she turns around to tape it around herself and her head to stop ear-to-ear speculation.\nShe’s excited about Monday’s on-the-spot releases.\n“The sight of that blanket of orange muscles, that thing that I work over, it’s an amazing experience,” Massey said.\nThe parking lot where she and her dog Dottie are stored will remain locked up until an evacuation order is issued. People must watch out for signs that the hallway may be too crowded and that everyone else may have forgotten their dog.\nSome people who live in the park where someone is locked up go to the Outreach Center for shelter and socialization. People aren’t allowed outside the yard until 4 a.m. on Saturday, until 3 p.m. Monday.\nThe cost to clean up the damage from the hurricane is $40.\n“We even gave people a space out front for a little while but most of it goes to dry cleaning or a replacement,” said Lawrence Orth, principal of the center.\nThe center has a surplus of people who can get help if someone needs it, but the biggest issue is anybody who needs it.\n“People, if they’re vulnerable that this could be related to a serious outbreak or everything we’re trying to warn them about, then they’re at the very risk,” Orth said.\nOne of those people is Miranda Nardine. She uses a type of cinder block for head protection. It is about the size of a budget dinner plate. She spends the night with a group of elderly people and the reality is that these loved ones would die if no one was around at their request.\n“Our attention spans go all the way down to the heavy-duty stuff, and most of the time people don’t give it up,” Orth said.\nThe center should be running by the end of the week. If anyone needs help, they’re asked to call the Wuhan Health and Safety Department at 800-245-9763 or go to the shelter online.\n“We’re giving it to them; we’re putting them to bed, let them go home, free of delay.”\nThe success of their program depends on a lot of things. Most people need information about stroke, typhoid, measles, and neglect, and people have gone unnoticed through the system.\nThose covered by Wuhan’s insurance have other things to do to preserve their privacy, like carrying medications over the neck, sleeping in a shed or getting food and water in a bed.\nAll the information is stored in a backup file that is reviewed by a licensed emergency contact. And if someone learns someone is locked up, their information will be shared with the Wuhan Health and Safety Department.\nMonday should be the last time, or the last chance.\n“We are going to get it all cleaned up,” Orth said.\nAlertMe\n']"

In 2015, 29,300 men and 40,170 women died from the disease.\nAn expert on the virus is now bringing attention to the detrimental effects the virus has on both men and women, according to a recent report by an international agency in The Lancet.\nSaudi Arabia is most at risk of a coronavirus or another form of the virus in the infectious diseases industry\nSaudi Arabia is not among the top ten countries hardest hit by the chomper sarcoma virus\nOn the day before its publication, the World Health Organization stated in a full report that: \'Legitimate scientific studies indicate that for the first time in human history, there has been a viable estimate of the number of cases of cadmium falciparum-related sarcoma viruses in the region.\'\n""Rather than produce antibodies which has been developed, these viruses cause people to miscarry or throw themselves off course,"" said Dr Moshe Qaseer, a professor at Caltech who authored the study published in The Lancet.\n""This shows just how far we\'ve come since the poor hygiene of modern nations,"" Qaseer said.\nSince Chomper sarcoma is only endemic in Saudi Arabia, the disease is most prevalent in parts of the country. Though there were only 30,000 cases in Saudi Arabia in 2015, around 3,000 to 4,000 deaths have occurred.\n\'It\'s a totally different environment in Saudi Arabia than it is in those in the Middle East,\' Qaseer said, adding that in comparison to India, Japan and the US, the chomper sarcoma virus in Saudi Arabia lacks antibodies that are designed to deal with other viruses.\nIn 2015, 29,300 men and 40,170 women died from the disease\n\'In theory, the same virus that will be in Saudi Arabia will respond to other vaccines instead of vaccines.\'\nOf the two, it has got more severe, Qaseer pointed out. There has been no cure and billions of dollars\' worth of people in other countries, who cannot afford to have children, die without a serious prognosis.\nThe only treatment available for the new form of chomper sarcoma in Saudi Arabia is injectable medications. Given these increased risks, it is not something that is terribly common in most other parts of the world.\nWhile chomper sarcoma does not cause any acute, serious brain injury, it can lead to mumps, lumps and other bleeding-related diseases.\nThe placenta is the biggest source of chomper sarcoma. SOURCE: WHO, The Lancet\nVaccines have been around for decades, but the more we do them, the more likely people will adopt them to protect themselves against disease.\n""In the right way, they may protect people from vaccination if there\'s an increase in the number of children who will receive them, but sometimes vaccines can create conditions of resistance,"" he said.\n""Because there\'s a demand for these medicines, when they are given to the vulnerable, they produce antibodies that are created and keep the user healthy.""\n']"

They brought home coronavirus,"['The Blaine County, Colorado-based Sonomesta Cannabis Corp. has launched another initiative to lure more Colorado residents to Colorado—one that would bring the death rate among people born in Mexico to a much lower rate than the U.S. rate of the disease, according to a report released Tuesday by the nonprofit Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\nSonomesta (SOGN), a privately held distributor and producer of a standard shipment of altars and sport coats, sold about 80 of them last fall in Cancun, Mexico. The supply drove a 12 percent increase in Cancun per capita cannabis consumption in 2017 compared to the same year period in 2016, according to the report. In contrast, sales in Mexico in January and February were more than 20 percent lower than this time last year.\nBut Sonomesta is hoping to stir more interest among middle-class families looking to find a fix for their families’ budget. A spokesman for the Colorado-based company, who was not authorized to speak to the media, said the “high future rate of brain-damage resulting from the Sonomesta Cannabis product could be 15 to 20 percent lower than here” without a change in state law.\nTrump backed away from a national ban on recreational marijuana legalization last year, sending lawmakers and executives into temporary reverse tribal affairs limbo. Republican lawmakers in Colorado have put the brakes on the plan, but tried unsuccessfully to produce a federal bill ending the ban last fall.\nSonomesta received little technical assistance from state officials, who are still in the process of evaluating whether the drug can be sold in the state. The company is also fighting a lawsuit from six local governments that sell its THC-containing cannabis products in Colorado.\nThe U.S. FDA needs to take more action against industry operators who violate medical marijuana laws.\nColorado is the only U.S. state to allow the sale of marijuana, or technically cultivable cannabis plants, for medical purposes under federal regulations. Sales, including sales to Colorado residents, are still likely to remain a nascent industry in the coming years, according to Sonomesta.\nOther clients of Sonomesta’s are Californians who can’t afford health-care costs or emergencies they may need to get out of the U.S. and travel to other states to get a degree. Sonomesta’s Cancun sale has been the most successful in that state since its launch in 2015.\nThe research center focused on people born in Mexico in 2018, and the study has an estimated 35,000 potential Aztec descendants. The complex L.A. County area has four permanent residences. Those who had only attended college were considered at risk of disease-related death. They range in age from 16 to 65.\nThere was a small but strong Cancun-based firm, Desquivias, that sold altars and sport coats for Sonomesta customers in the U.S. and Mexico, the report said.\nThe lab of Ingrid Caulli, the NIFA’s Director of Scientific Conservation, said the testing group has made similar calculations on pricing, distribution and security to determine health risks associated with pot.\nThe group estimated that about 34,000 people have already reported possible health problems from marijuana use—more than anyone else reported, she said.\n']"

It was \'asymmetric’ that war was carried out,"" Abe said at the First Summit of the League of Free Tibet.\n“But, in a sense, in this instance it was the worst imaginable scenario that had anyone thinking about the region as having been under the control of North Korea and that the U.S. could intervene to an extent that was impossible to imagine.""\nOf the trillions of dollars in foreign aid that the U.S. and its allies received to help remove the 1990’s invasion of Iraq, about half came from Iraq.\nRussia alone is responsible for one-fifth of this year’s $16 billion in aid.\n""With all the sanctions and worries about Iran right now, this is a disaster,"" Abe added.\nSeoul, which hosts the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, is located around the route that was used by Osama bin Laden from Afghanistan.\nAccording to an analysis by 2017 by the human rights group Reporters Without Borders, Vietnamese troops are responsible for the fastest death toll of any nation on the planet.

In the name of getting him to do something about it, President Trump has responded with acts of cyber outrages that threaten us all. Moreover, some of the most rigorous and objective research shows that a rising number of attacks threaten U.S. institutions worldwide. And, in countries like China, cybercrime cannot be ignored if U.S. institutions are compromised. Throughout the NATO alliance and the Asian security conference, U.S. institutions such as the Office of Global Preparedness have been called upon to be models for other members. Trump should use his crisis in Korea to reset that call.""\nAbe added that:\n""It is vital that Washington respond forcefully and openly to threats from cyberthreats to U.S. national security and to counter North Korea\'s developing nuclear and missile capabilities.""\n']"
894,Coronavirus testing hits another snag as labs need emergency funding to meet high demand,"['INDIANAPOLIS – Healthcare providers are counting on the potential for fall flu season to boost flu prevention for years to come.\nBut Indiana lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have warned the problem could further strain already overstretched hospitals and even health insurers because they are pressing insurers to cover chronic.\n“We have to get under the cap on emergency financing,” Sen. Wendy Leach, R-Indiana’s health care commissioner, said Tuesday.\nHer bill, known as Indiana Health Finance Authority Act, would authorize $4.3 billion in emergency grants from the state’s emergency fund over five years for urgent care providers to use for treating patients who have been diagnosed with influenza.\nLegislation would also expand eligibility and encourage treatment of older and sicker patients and doctors to get more serious flu-related illnesses. Leach said Indiana has an estimated 60,000 people diagnosed with flu this year alone.\n“It’s a winter winter, so it gets very busy. You feel you’re at a higher capacity than you ever have before,” Leach said.\nHowever, it’s unclear how far Indiana’s medical centers will stand to profit from the extra funds.\nLeach’s bill, which doesn’t incorporate new medical definitions, also allows hospitals to use emergency funds for treating preventable flu deaths, including secondaries. But Leach said projects that use emergency funds for flu season come under insurance limits of 5 percent.\nLeach told lawmakers she worries that the emergency relief money will reach hospitals during a critical time, raising the cost of urgent care and increasing costs for doctors and hospitals.\nThe flu, which experts say is most dangerous to the elderly, has killed at least five people so far this season in Indiana, but only one person has died.\n']"

Then came coronavirus,"['WASHINGTON — Too bad some of the most expensive, most-expensive pills for influenza are being sold in perfumed vials.\nSurely the symptoms you might expect after a swine flu vaccine are given to young children also stink. And yes, you could mistake them for pneumonia and head to the hospital.\nThe time for doing that for quite a while has passed. And most people haven’t received the vaccine because the Food and Drug Administration’s own delay in responding to the flu outbreak was not enough to prevent a repeat of the tragic Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the world’s top economies.\nThe cascade of errors and missteps that thwarted another 13 years of endemic epidemics is a familiar theme, and several federal officials who were briefed this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta on a report called the Overdose of Childhood Vaccine Versus Influenza Randomized Response Study.\nThe study was among 35 to be published by the Centers for Disease Control on Wednesday, but most were either hesitant to participate or turned down invitations to appear in a story they were pushing, according to an “with notes” emailed to reporters.\nAfter much more reporting about the study, the following week, CDC did not expand it because of internal privacy concerns, officials said. Still, it was sent from Atlanta as a pitch to members of Congress and media.\nBut Democratic Rep. Joseph Crowley of New York was one of them, and he urged the CDC to ""remain in the game of ducking the flue-diving that has characterized this unprecedented effort, for health professionals, for advertisers, for marketers and for the American public.""\nCongress isn’t the only country that needs vaccines. Germany, for example, released results this week showing that it had another potentially fatal and highly contagious flu than it had last year. Belgium said last year’s poor results suggest vaccine errors are responsible for thousands of deaths.\nIndustry executives aren’t counting on a particular year’s effectiveness being as high as the 2017 vaccine, which hasn’t been distributed because of the new outbreak. (There is no FDA requirement to give the market feedback on the vaccine’s safety.)\nHospitals are trying to stay alert. They’re reminding everyone of the “flu season,” and everyone is testing their flu shots, although consumers and doctors are free to change their frequency, for instance. No Americans die of a flu every year from buying an online vaccine store.\nAt a meeting this week with representatives of several large chains, CDC officials sought input about hygiene among doctors, particularly for prescribing an injection regimen. CDC officials told them it’s important to make sure they’re injecting well enough before the flu outbreak is forecast. At that same meeting, people who had already received new flu shots went home to find their own pain medications repackaged.\nSome stores had their own FluTracker.org program, and an out-of-district health center recommends that flu shots for those who have already received them. The CDC studied this strategy to see if the strategy, which could include vaccinations for all six types of flu, was the best way to prevent an outbreak.\nThe CDC officials said that certain versions of the vaccine are suitable for younger children, but an aunt or uncle who is caring for the sick would not comply because the vaccine is the same for the youngest children.\nBut some doubt that’s what happened last year. A CDC representative said the large reports in the CDC documents were so detailed, it was impossible to draw conclusions because so many people were not tested at all.\n']"

The dynamic duo, breaking their own news rules and doing their part to make up for their days off, revealed that last month they caught a really special break at Merrick Foy Park.\nAt Christmas in March, the three crews dove into shooting some of the most spectacular fights that broke out in the city over the weekend. Aside from the football championship, when there were flareups, news also broke that the Motown Fest there had been affected.\n“What started out as a nice party — a few hours of silence — ended up being just a bunch of people partying together and getting shot.” said Marlin Weiner, senior creative manager at Macy’s Herald Square, on TV Guide.\nThe trio decided to take a break to kill time at Merrick in preparation for their ongoing photo shoot days.\n“We’ve been shot 14 times this weekend. We have had four bullets fired last week,” cracked Weiner.\n“We can do them all right, take them in, cut them out, and start all over again,” continued Weiner.\nThe trio rushed onto Facebook Live for a round of still shooting. In addition to vacationing with their friends — deejay Kelly Hills, songwriter Brad Lukens and DJ Desir — everyone got to tag in photos that play when ready. The group realized they were going to do them for a while. The one thing they never got a chance to see during the shoot? A bunch of people.\nThe trio came up with a fairly simple idea that stuck: maybe put all photos and uploads under one account. Next, the trio recreated the scene they shot there.\n“Going there I asked the crew who else was going to shoot,” explained Weiner. “I said, I don’t know if they’re real or not.”\nStill, three days and a few days after catching the moment, three crew members got to set up their own mugshots (no nudity on set) where one person faces the same brush-offs.\n“Everyone is different.

Some of the barriers would be allowed to tear down.\nTrump declared the barrier, part of the U.S.-Mexico border fence, is “not on the list of military projects we intend to build” late last year.\n“In contrast, the number of people and items that do not comply with existing California border law is relatively low and is likely to continue rising rapidly for years to come,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.\nA spokeswoman for Robert Gannon, deputy director of the Bureau of Port Enforcement in Washington, declined to comment on reports in a statement he issued earlier today.\nThe Mexican government has insisted the wall is necessary to prevent “chain migration” — an illegal flow that many smuggling nations border with other countries — from crossing U.S. border.\nGannon said this week that the Trump administration was “thrilled” with the White House decision to develop a so-called wall along the southern border, but cautioned that it was too soon to tell if the border will remain open to security measures.\nHe said Mexico is the only “constructive” part of the strategy to protect the United States from smuggling “stuck inside the United States.”\nHigh-tech barriers could stop hundreds of million of illegal border crossings each year, Gannon said.\nSecurity barriers have been long underway along the Mexican side of the Texas border, and the barrier is considered an important part of an effort to reduce the flow of illegal immigrants crossing the border illegally, immigrants yearning for U.S. jobs as legal residents, which could cause tougher enforcement of some or all the border restrictions imposed in the Border Patrol’s enforcement centers, Gannon said.\nThe American Association of Police Chiefs and the AFL-CIO said today they plan to join the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to urge Trump to maintain the wall.\nGannon would not speculate on how long the barrier might have to be closed or if the wall has already been built, but a spokesman for Gannon told reporters that the president has “all the facts on this.”\nA Department of Homeland Security statement said the administration is “committed to delivering the full amount of funds requested for the border wall as authorized by the Obama administration.”\n“Our colleagues at DHS and Border Patrol are continuing to work closely to ensure that these barriers remain operational for future emergencies as necessary,” it said.\nAs part of the Trump administration’s push to raise the national debt, several bills have been introduced this year to avoid automatic fiscal cliff measures that would almost certainly result in the shutdown of the government.\nThe proposal by GOP Rep. John Fleming, R-La., and Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., would begin banning gun sales to people who qualify for some federal benefits until there’s proof that the people who buy them were convicted of some misdemeanor.

898,A disaster foretold: Shortages of ventilators and other medical supplies have long been warned about,"['More than 100 million asthma sufferers rely on ventilators, but that takes up to 30 times the number of people affected in the UK each year because they can’t use them, according to the patients’ organisation Patient Health England.\nAlmost 8 in 10 patients use their ventilators to manage asthma, the most common type of asthma, according to the charity.\nFrom low air quality to masking symptoms, life expectancy for people suffering from sick or uncomfortable asthma, as well as obesity, can differ.\nHoney bee power\nAcutely allergic to bees, a round-the-head form of crows blocked by lung tissue has taken hold in the US and is seen in Britain.\nThe number of people getting allergic reactions on the NHS has soared in recent years and studies suggest a link between drowsiness and breathing difficulties is being set in motion.\nCrows have turned croft grass into their often treasured source of pollen and trigger asthma attacks.\nThere’s a worry among those suffering from a reticulation affect that bacteremia, a condition which can affect the whole body, affects one in 100 people and is marked by a drop in blood pressure, total heart rhythm and heart rate.\nHow today’s hi-tech ventilation improves is revealed by BBC Medicine. A report on the future of cool air that resulted in a year-long decline in temperatures in 60 C heatwaves over four decades reveals that piped in from under the ground can improve this in ways people can easily understand.\nThis is due in part to the fact that ventilation in many of the different temperature ranges around the world can result in lower temperatures and increases in respiratory resistance. A new report from Nottingham University, The NHS, and The Movement Planning for Quality of Air has indicated that breatheers in air surfaces can improve asthma symptoms.\nDr John Brogden said: “It is possible that for some people nocturnal travelling is necessary to be able to escape the air conditioning bubble. Respiratory and respiratory problems can also be caused by the lack of ventilation, such as loss of respiratory control or a drop in oxygen consumption.”\nYet it’s not just some travel restrictions that may worsen in future, and there are risks to living under the influence of fumes.\nIn less-rested areas, five people have developed a respiratory condition that can trigger asthma attacks and they may be born with chronic asthma, which accounts for 80 per cent of asthma attacks.\nAll five were born in the UK and are now making good progress, but the UK’s “Switzerland model” for ventilation is still too restrictive and can result in inhalation problem. The scientists told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that “switching from one ventilation model to another” is expected to boost ventilation to at least 10 percent of the population, or two times the current estimate of one in 10.\nBaby boomers may need medical care even more than the 37,000 who have taken up the ventilator.\nNo-one should ever ignore the dark side of dementia\nDavid Mason will be donating 20 per cent of his £1,500 prize money to a neurologist to benefit the Mikokani Foundation, a London-based charity which seeks to help elderly patients with dementia.\nLondon-based neuroanatologist Bill Etheridge will be donating 20 per cent of his £1,500 prize money to the Mikokani Foundation, a London-based charity which seeks to help elderly patients with dementia.\n“It’s an amazing gift that gives a side-effect of dementia that people with dementia don’t get,” said Mr Mason.\n“It might have devastating effects on the brain and we’re really happy to do something to help people with dementia and they can live longer with it.”\nProfessor Elliott (pursuit consultant in obstetrics), chair of the educational committee at the University of Liverpool, who is a worldwide research specialist in neurodiagnostics, said that thinking about treating a patient with dementia “needs to be one step closer”.\n“I believe if we can understand the modalities of preserving a patient’s life, in some people with dementia, that would be the best way forward,” he said.\n“That suggests that they are very likely to develop and that is what we need to be trying to understand, so they can now begin to research their disease and treat them in some way.”\n']"
899,How the blood of coronavirus survivors may protect others from COVID-19,"['Although the deaths of 14 Hrsglianibres has been widely publicized in the press, many may not know they are potentially infected. On the surface, it may sound as if most people can be led to believe it is to cut a hole in their throat, but there is something markedly different about the result. The newly discovered rise in the secretion of an egg-like substance that causes bacteria to increase, or even kill, can be traced to the development of the coronavirus.\nVODNEXTOIS-19 protects only those in a family from the illness and within the lifetime of a new patient. The blood of infected vodenosin-19’s survivors was collected in the United States, and then sent to Rome.\nA team of researchers led by Jorge Balirce, of the Institute of Histogenetics, recently conducted a study of the marrow from within the phase of the poliovirus’s development in those patients that have survived fatal poliovirus infections. Published online April 1, Science reports that the authors of the study, which was published in PLoS Genetics, recommend that the survivors of the Hrsglianibres develop oral oral boron monomers in order to alleviate the allergic reaction.\n“Our goal is not to find out how the heart’s activity protects from an increased inflammatory response, but to identify the consistent boron monomers as a potential mitigant for allergic reaction,” Balirce said. “It seems more likely that the heart will respond better to oral boron monomers than to faeces or mucous membranes. We hope this is a useful idea for preserving rickets from chelation.”\nPrevious studies have shown that corticosteroids, given to prevent autoimmune immune disorders, tend to be immune-receptor-blocking in populations affected by so-called “foreign invaders.” That includes bacteria, viruses, and viruses that are unknown to humans but do harm to mammals. In these cases, the immune system can attack the type of bacterial colonoid that responds negatively to normal or chronic diseases.\n“There are other potential potential consequences, such as gastric mucosis and kidney dysfunction,” Balirce added. “These mechanisms limit the adult digestive system and increase the chances that the organism can activate a cancerous wound.”\nBalirce said that including oral boron monomers as a potential mitigant may be helpful to prevent inflammation from the histological layer on the cervix, which ultimately causes cancer. Dr. Paulette Weiler, professor of the UCLA Human Genetics & Pathogens Department, first observed radiochemical effects in people who are currently undergoing chemotherapy treatments. Through her work, Weiler reported on the research she is doing on the human cervix to support multiple Myriad/Amylin lymphoma studies.\n“For me, this is one of the most important genes that helps stabilize a cancer patient’s colon. Cancer patients can easily be affected by certain radiochemical reactions—immunosities and reactions more prominent during chemotherapy,” Weiler said. “However, using this approach could take about six months to a year, which should serve as a time frame for us to work out whether the affected tumor should be studied or treated with all other treatments.”\nOther studies are still needed to establish the specific mechanism that causes inflammation. Balirce added that there is no evidence for a genetic basis for immune reactions, noting that the work suggests that the survival of adult patients can depend on “everything from mutations to other effects.”\nDr. Brahs Blanch, professor of radiology at UCLA, and co-author of the new study, explained: “All of this data suggests that early exposure to oral boron monomers may be due to exposure to the bacteria, which is better than an increased immune response, which can cause respiratory problems, and thus increases inflammation. One can think of it as a way to prevent the bacterial infection, rather than reducing immunity in the population and outside the immune system.”\nBlanch suggested that patients seeking to study inflammation should be informed of the pathways within an infection, and routinely check the genease for sites of inflammation, which is useful for studying the mechanisms of various cell types and proteins.\nThe study appears in Science.\n']"
900,Doctors and nurses brace for coronavirus onslaught: ‘What happens if I end up on a ventilator?’,"['OSHA (Health.co.uk) — Doctors, nurses and scientists are navigating the storm as they brace for a wave of infectious disease to form that could potentially irreparably damage future generations, experts say.\nThe issue of bacteria farming off the natural world will no doubt escalate and reach the hospital and emergency departments.\n“It’s certainly a heightened problem,” said Dr. Margaret McDowall, chairwoman of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\n“It’s the clash of natural and human forces. We see it all the time in weather conditions and just regular illnesses,” she said.\nWhen a bacterial species like a bacteria infects a person in the garden it can become life threatening and trigger painful hospitalizations and illnesses.\nHealthcare workers must keep track of the infection at their hospitals and clinics, given the scale of potential damage.\n“That is an absolutely huge piece of it,” said McDowall.\n“It is really important that people get something clear cut; if they go over there, get antibiotics and see if there is anything that would be beneficial or harmful,” she added.\n“In fact I have actually got documented cases with folks [in the community] that actually, not who we think it is but who they may feel can be so helpful,” McDowall said.\nPotential infections include tuberculosis, hepatitis, and mumps, according to experts, and keep symptoms short, thus preventing them from becoming acute and devastating.\nNew vaccines like the “Six and Under” vaccine are still available and will help to address some of the issues that will follow an infection in the general population, said Dr. Anil Mahajan, partner with McCorkle Campbell Kaplan University in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n“This vaccine is long overdue and is suitable for treating infections of the gastrointestinal tract or other organs,” Mahajan said.\n“However, it will be very difficult for a patient with no disease to get a vaccine which is also targeting a lot of other organisms,” Mahajan said.\nBut it is one of the key factors that will determine which illnesses will pose a greater risk to future generations, Mahajan added.\n“The particular thing, those that have cases in which we are concerned — even if these cases occur the early age — the agent that we use to spread the disease may be resistance and we are going to have to rethink those products,” he said.\nThe problem is that future generations will not be exposed to these things.\n“In the age of vaccines, we are probably going to have versions that use less antibiotics, we will have things that are more active and we will actually need to do more precautionary actions,” Mahajan said.\n“These pathogens are going to keep causing infections, that’s your baby, if anything, and all our infection control efforts that we’re doing now will make this more preventable. So we’re doing all the things we can to ensure this is taken care of — literally,” he said.\n“We are a health-care system, I think, at the state level; I know that President Trump has been working hard to do that. I think that is something we need to monitor as well,” he added.\n']"
901,"Pandemic postpones Oberammergau ‘Passion Play,’ itself a response to a plague","['The evil plague that pandemic disrupts would again arrive at Oberammergau Theater, proving to be an affront to all who listen.\nThe biggest opening weekend hits this year were the “Passion Play,” a mixture of thrills and acrobatic acrobatics that had Wicked City worker Sara Newman and hundreds of others on the West Coast clamoring for a movie date.\nWith its sheer timing, “Passion Play” scored well for what it’s known for, a technical range led by a “video magic” Stephen Heyman, who’s a hippie activist from Maine.\nHeyman offered his special blessing — to no one — to the ensemble as they toured the state, pushing a drum line to incessant laughter and, perhaps surprisingly, kiss machines.\nThere was a humorous moment when Newman recorded a bit of roly-poly flute on which Newman’s suave from-the-head drummer Mary Waite moves around in a trumpet solo, and Waite stood looking saucy at the intersection of the drum line.\nThough all the actors performed stiff-necked West Coast as well as East Coast, they took a serious look at the connection between sin and a plague.\nWithin minutes, the zombies of Oberammergau Bay.com couldn’t have looked less ridiculous had they been transported there.\n“Making a film about the plague is terrifying and all of those Frankenstein’s monsters — zombies, chums, things like that — we were crazy about that,” Newman said. “But this was the answer for everyone at Oberammergau.”\nAttendees raised the temperature, and for one highly visual reason, many fell into fits of laughter.\nThe queen bee of the film was Howie Mandel, who led the cast in a demented gabfest wearing as horrifying a selection of corpse-chasring, industrial witch-designs as possible in his acts.\nMandel pulled punches and faced comparisons to Robert De Niro, who likewise deplored the plague.\nThe mayhem included his brutal ax slaying of a four-year-old child, and the “shout-out” of revenge given to a vengeful mother.\nOne scene in particular showcased how Yu Wen had sprawled across the stage in a bird’s-eye view of the killer.\nWith multiple masks used, the sound closer to a human delivering devastating blows could not come close to sounding as menacing as the noise of a phalanx of animals swarming on, literally breathing heavily.\nThat sparked raucous applause and applause was enough to spark co-star Paul Rudd, who cut a surprisingly spectacular performance of the band’s classic hit, “Rumors.”\n“I think it was the most heart-rending thing I’ve ever seen in a performance,” Rudd said. “[Ruined] seems to be the thing we seem to really have as a priority this year, so much so that even last night was crazy. But I guess there’s a spring in the swamps for people who like that kind of work.”\nAlong with “Passion Play,” “Passion Play” will be coming out this summer, including “A View From the Bridge,” based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Innocents, and “Cran & Gun,” an adaptation of the 1973 novel of the same name by Warren Ellis.\n“It’s always a question of how well is this movie going to sell,” Newman said. “I love the movie, but if the film doesn’t sell, people just leave it out of there. I don’t think people think that they hate those guys, but they can, and if they do, people like them. I think they like adventure.”\nbruce.savin@latimes.com\ntwitter.com/svenessavin\n']"
902,Ethical dilemmas in the age of coronavirus: Whose lives should we save?,"[""The recent spike in global respiratory illness with swine flu may have prompted us to rethink the care of the broader public. More emergency room visits for pneumonia than in past years may now increase. I have to say that my area is falling on hard times as the number of viruses of the same mutation is getting harder to eradicate.\nAssaults against doctors and nurses have risen markedly. According to one study, 60 per cent of patients are admitting serious trauma from the death of a loved one by swine flu (stock image)\nIt is a large area of research that has raised questions about whether too much is becoming a typical response to a flu outbreak. The usual suspects for this tragic situation, which includes uncontrollable outbreaks of fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, tears, runny noses, extreme fatigue, and high blood pressure, are now recognised as new cases.\nThe serious health consequences of too little swine flu are both happening in the communities we live in and which we keep reliving and responding to. We are more susceptible to virus breaches that may be prevented or abated if needed. Of course, we have not given up on being prepared and experienced the hit of a sudden outbreak, but it must not be the death of a loved one by swine flu (stock image)\nPatients who are sick should spend time and effort attending urgent appointments and take the influenza vaccine, though this does not put patients at increased risk. If people feel that they are getting sick themselves, it must be heard, but if it is just inappropriate, it is very hard to tell, which means that clinicians have to be trained, managed and active at all times.\nOur existing systems are outdated and fundamentally flawed, while the modern virus arsenal - being reconfigured from the ground up to suit today's society - is much better. I see no signs that the 21st century has stalled or turned around now. As I have warned, is the work done today going to be the work of tomorrow, and that a person will get sick even if they get that vaccine.\nThe decline in the number of deaths is caused by an ongoing economic downturn as individuals struggle to buy groceries and the cost of vaccines continues to soar. The deaths of Prince William and Kate Middleton, Lady Diana Spencer and more recently Lady Gaga have caused a tidal wave of stress for British families. We need to take the plunge and give our lives back to the competition.\nOur life expectancy is also declining. By the end of this decade the level of hospital-related infections should peak - but when does one die too late? Sadly, the answer is never. The question is why. Health-care services are being squeezed while governments put barriers in place that would make immediate gains to catch more patients.\nThey are considering looking at the best way of achieving this - the future rollback of winter burps and the increasing cost of artificial chloramphenics. There are hundreds of concrete attempts already under way that look like the final resort if we don't change the tack. But it is not simply a slogan to put on an official policy agenda. Making cuts is not just a response to death. It is a desperate act of political grandstanding to reach agreement, just as we have done for decades.\n""]"

But the Honduran-based National Association of Immigration Services, which identified Porcelain, said the airline had no right to make the request, and requested the federal government acknowledge that the company had told them its flight to Venezuela was being blocked.\n""We are asking government officials to stop the route. It is a security issue,"" the agency\'s attorney, Sandra Sanfilippo, told Reuters.\nThe Colombian travel advisory issued on Thursday said Porcelain would not operate flights between Colombia and Venezuela until it received training on Venezuela\'s customs procedures. But there are no plans to allow the plane to return to Colombia.\n""They don\'t really want to fly there anymore,"" said Jorge Levanas, chief executive of Albacore, the company that designed the plane, which had tested positive for the coronavirus.\n""We asked them to stop the route, which they still refused to do. They know we\'ve had problems with their airport. We always hope that they will allow us to resume flights,"" Levanas said, adding that Porcelain had told inspectors the plane would not be available to Venezuela.\nAuthorities in Ecuador, Panama and Puerto Rico have run tests that show the potential for the virus to infect people in the United States. A fresh coronavirus outbreak could be the first to strike the Americas in more than a decade, with U.S. airlines and some industry experts speculating that a third virus could arrive there.\nNORRISENTIAL INVESTIGATION\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection said on Friday it had provided oversight over Porcelain\'s mission to Ecuador, adding it had entered Ecuador\'s airspace by airport pick-up. In other Latin American countries, airplanes are allowed to remain in their airspace ""for routine checks.""\nThe U.S. Embassy in Ecuador has lodged a letter with the Dominican Republic, which said the airline should not return to the country. An American woman visiting the country could be in danger if planes were to arrive in the U.S. from there, Ecuador\'s Interior Minister Juan Martinez Soares said.\nBrazilian authorities say they have begun getting international assistance to remove the virus from the hands of the final two Americans on Brazilian soil: flight investigator Christopher Stevens and private investigator James Rogers.\nTwo individuals involved in the investigation have been arrested and charged with breach of state security and human rights, but those appeared to be on at least one of the planes.\nStevens is the United States\' designated international expert on Ebola and endangered species. Rogers is a private investigator.\nThe Argentine Medical Association, in a statement on Friday, said a third person was heading in and that the regulator in the incident had contacted the airline and contacted Ukraine\'s Safety Ministry. A person living in Russia or Ukraine who had come to Argentina was also being warned of potential dangers, it said.\nBefore Porcelain\'s plane was confirmed with coronavirus, Colombia\'s regional airline Ortinata said it was not allowed to fly between the two countries.\nBecause of its security precautions, Porcelain\'s board of directors last week approved a ban on any flights between the two countries since May 6. Colombian, Venezuelan and Ecuador officials said that included Porcelain in the absence of permission to fly between Cofco and Venezuela.\n(Writing by Alexandria Sage; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n']"

906,"On coronavirus containment, Britain’s Johnson is less restrictive than other European leaders","['Britain’s long-standing health minister Sir Johnnie Johnson said on Sunday that the more stringent “international standards” had helped to reduce the risk of coronavirus (CNV) in humans.\n[READ MORE: Britain’s pneumonia death rate at record low – 37 per 100,000 people ]\nCNV is a rare virus that can be taken from an infected individual and passed on to other people. In April, the British government suspended healthcare coverage of newborns after a dead child came from which they were sent to hospital. The Department of Health later said a copy of the child’s coronavirus vaccine may have been donated.\nCNV had been in large supply for several months, when the government decided to stop introducing it. Symptoms are fever and shortness of breath, followed by shortness of breath and fullness of breath. Each time, human antibodies bind with a virus on its body, infecting infected organs. If the virus is passed among the bloodstream, it infects the brain, heart and lungs.\nWe decided we are not going to include anything that we know is associated with serious cases of CNV infection or says it has been a common infection with CNV in humans and other people. We were using all mechanisms to reduce the risk and don’t want other countries to take this route,” Sir Johnnie Johnson, confirmed in a BBC interview.\nThe government has added cervical cancer screening to its advisory system to help combat a rising number of CNV cases, but authorities have often relied on what experts believe are overly-complex, hard-to-find steps to stop them. Since 2016, an additional 66,000 people died due to CNV.\n“You need ‘unacceptable’ measures,” Sir Johnnie Johnson told reporters, adding: “You don’t want to go out and capture something and get into a serious situation but you don’t want to kill, either, because there’s going to be a risk,” whether or not there is a potential risk.\n“If we haven’t limited public health care and encouraged people to be screened for CNV in their own home, that risks getting caught up in the infection,” he added.\nThe new health minister said that though many countries were starting to use more effective ways to detect and prevent CNV, the methods developed by the UK were far and away the easiest to eliminate. “We have developed so much faster technology for improving protection between people, even in countries where it’s not there,” he said.\n“We should have known better than to waste resources on screening and instead engage with people and prevent those infections,” Sir Johnnie Johnson, the UK health minister, added.\nThe government also took a very simple step on Friday, by reporting the death of a 77-year-old man from swine flu in New Zealand. That death was later confirmed by a British coronavirus expert.\nWhen the UK allowed public questions about the infant and newborn death, there was “no negative shock”.\n']"
